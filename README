TIImageTool

Version 3.0.6
September 2024

A tool for working with TI99 disk images 
intended for use in emulators

NICKNAME
--------

TIImageTool is sometimes referred to as TIMT.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

1. Java

You need a recent Java Runtime Environment and a JDK for building. As of 2016, 
Java is available from Oracle's web site. Alternatively, you can use
the Open Source implementation OpenJDK via

   http://openjdk.java.net/


2. Serial support (RXTX)
   
Also, to be able to compile TIImageTool, you have to put a copy of
the RXTXcomm.jar library into the ext folder. During runtime, RXTX need not
be installed; the depending features will be disabled in that case.

RXTX is available from Github (https://github.com/rxtx/rxtx).
   

3. Raw device access (CF7)

For reading from and writing to CF7 cards, raw device access is required 
which is not easily feasible for Java programs, and across different platforms.
Moreover, popular Linux distributions dropped the gksu tool for security 
reasons. 

For these reasons, I decided to drop the built-in support for reading and 
writing CF7 cards. The "dd" program ("dd.exe" for Windows) is a suitable tool
for reading and writing CF cards. Instead of calling the "dd" tool, TIImageTool
will now just suggest a command line that you have to use.

After pulling an image dump from the CF card, you can easily work with it in
TIImageTool, including adding/removing volumes, and of course working on those
volumes. Later, you have to use dd to write back the changed image.

If you do not plan to work with CF7 cards, you need not care about all this.


INSTALLING and RUNNING
----------------------

Unpack the distribution zip package. You can launch TIImageTool 

- from the command line using

     java -jar tiimagetool.jar

- from the desktop in Windows by

     double-click on tiimagetool.jar

- from the desktop in Linux/MacOS or other systems

     depends on your system configuration; make sure that the JAR 
     file type is associated with starting the Java environment.

     
DOCUMENTATION
-------------

TIImageTool contains a built-in manual that you can open with F1. Also have a look
at my website (www.mizapf.de) for updates.
