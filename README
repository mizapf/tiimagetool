TIImageTool

Version 2.4.6
June 2018

A tool for working with TI99 disk images 
intended for use in emulators

NICKNAME
--------

TIImageTool is sometimes referred to as TIMT.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

1. Java

You need a recent Java Runtime Environment and a JDK for building. As of 2016, 
Java is available from Oracle's web site. Alternatively, you can use
the Open Source implementation OpenJDK via

   http://openjdk.java.net/


2. Serial support (RXTX)
   
Also, to be able to compile TIImageTool, you have to put a copy of
the RXTXcomm.jar library into the ext folder. During runtime, RXTX need not
be installed; the depending features will be disabled in that case.

RXTX is available from rxtx.qbang.org or from Github. 
   

3. Raw device access (DD)

For reading from and writing to CF7 cards, raw device access is required 
which is not easily feasible for Java programs. For this reason, TIMT will 
make use of the "dd" utility program. It is run in a separate process with
elevated rights.

Common Linux systems already come with a dd program (usually /usr/bin/dd), 
so there is no need for a special installation. Check with your distribution
in case of doubt. The same should be true for MacOS/OSX.

For Windows there is a port released by Chrysocome and John Newbigin under 
GPL2 license (see http://www.chrysocome.net/dd). You can move the dd.exe 
file to any suitable location, as long as you specify the location in the
preferences.

If you do not plan to work with CF7 cards, you need not care about all this.


INSTALLING and RUNNING
----------------------

Unpack the distribution zip package. You can launch TIImageTool 

- from the command line using

     java -jar tiimagetool.jar

- from the desktop in Windows by

     double-click on tiimagetool.jar

- from the desktop in Linux/MacOS or other systems

     depends on your system configuration; make sure that the JAR 
     file type is associated with starting the Java environment.



BUGS and SUGGESTIONS

bug reports to ti99@mizapf.de.
