TIImageTool

Version 2.3
October 2016

A tool for working with TI99 disk images 
intended for use in emulators



PREREQUISITES
-------------

You need a recent Java Runtime Environment and a JDK for building. As of 2016, 
Java is available from Oracle's web site. Alternatively, you can use
the Open Source implementation OpenJDK via

   http://openjdk.java.net/


Also, to be able to compile TIImageTool, you have to put a copy of
the RXTXcomm.jar library into the ext folder. During runtime, RXTX need not
be installed; the depending features will be disabled in that case.

RXTX is available from rxtx.qbang.org or from Github. 
   

INSTALLING and RUNNING
----------------------

Unpack the distribution zip package. You can launch TIImageTool 

- from the command line using

     java -jar tiimagetool.jar

- from the desktop in Windows by

     double-click on tiimagetool.jar

- from the desktop in Linux/MacOS or other systems

     depends on your system configuration; make sure that the JAR 
     file type is associated with starting the Java environment.
