NewCF7Hint1=If you want to create a new image for a CF7 card,

NewCF7Hint3=Short explanation: Compact Flash cards sometimes offer less than the exact amount of\nmemory as printed on their casing, so you may get into trouble when copying the image\non the CF card.
NewCF7Hint4=Hence, you should use the \"Read Compact Flash Card\" function first, which produces\nan image file, then format the volumes as desired with \"Format CF7\". This way, you\nwill get an image that suits your CF card; copy it to the CF card with \"Write Compact\nFlash Card\" finally.
NewCF7Hint5=This is a single volume for a CF7-formatted card.
