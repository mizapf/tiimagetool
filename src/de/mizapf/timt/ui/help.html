<a name="why"></a>
<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>The objective of this tool is to simplify working with disk images for 
TI-99 systems. Disk images are, simply speaking, floppy disks or hard disks 
that have been saved as a file. These images are used in some emulators like 
MAME instead of using a real floppy drive or hard drive, mainly because the
PC hardware does not directly support the device operations coming from the
emulated TI. Instead, the emulator only works with a disk image, and the 
emulator "believes" to see a real disk.</p>
<p>Disk images can be created with most emulators, also with MAME, but apart
from creating them, only little support for changing the image contents is
available. Certainly, images change while we work with the emulator, because
the emulated system performs write operations, and so we can copy files on the
image, delete them, and also read them. But multi-system emulators like MAME
simply cannot implement all the handling for every single system.</p>
<p>TIImageTool is a program which allows you to create and modify TI disk
images in an intuitive way, including common file management features
that we know from PC systems. Disk images can be created with different sizes, 
files can be copied from one disk to another, files can be imported and exported, 
and file systems can be checked for errors.</p>
<p>In the following sections I will go through each feature of the program and 
explain its usage.</p>

<h4>Program dialog</h4>
<div class="program">
Elements like this in the following text indicate explanations for topics within
dialog windows of the program. If you wonder what to select when invoking some
feature, look out for the respective element with a heading that belongs to the
dialog window.
</div>

<a name="required"></a>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>For using TIImageTool you only need a <span class="imp">Java Runtime 
Environment</span> version 6 and higher. If you are reading this text from the help menu you
obviously already have a working Java environment on your computer. Remember to
install a Java Runtime on each system where you intend to use TIImageTool.</p>
<p>One specific feature of TIImageTool is the <a href="#serialbr">Serial bridge</a>.
This allows you to transfer files to and from another computer system via
XModem file exchange. The other computer system may be a real TI or Geneve,
so you can easily exchange your files between the PC and the TI. In order to 
use the serial bridge you need the serial interface support for Java. TIImageTool
uses the <a href="#rxtx">RXTX</a> serial library, so you have to install this library if you
want to use the bridge. If you do not install it, you can use all features 
of TIImageTool without limitations except for the serial connection which will
then be unavailable.</p>
<p>If you want to work with Compact Flash cards that are used with the CF7
expansion system (or the <em>nanoPEB</em>), you also need a program to read
directly from a storage device. This program is called <strong>dd</strong>,
and it is already part of every Linux distribution or MacOS, but not of 
a normal Windows installation. You have to download the <strong>DD for Windows</strong>
program; it is simply one EXE file that you should store at a location that
you easily remember. You can set the path to DD.EXE in the preferences.</p>

<a name="starting"></a>
<h2>Starting</h2>
<p>TIImageTool is started by double-clicking the JAR file (if the JAR file
type is associated to the Java Runtime Environment). Alternatively, you can start
the program on the command line</p>
<div class="code">java -jar tiimagetool.jar [<em>imageFile</em>]</div>
<p>If you provide the optional <em>imageFile</em> argument, TIImageTool will
directly open the image on startup. In case you simply want to use the serial bridge feature without all the 
other things, you can pass the BRIDGE argument in the command line like this: 
</p>
<div class="code">java -jar tiimagetool.jar BRIDGE <em>serialDevice</em> <em>socketPort</em></div>
<p>Please see below (<a href="#serial">serial bridge</a>) for more details.</p>

<a name="formats"></a>
<h2>Supported formats</h2>
<p>Image files that can be used with TIImageTool may have one of the following formats:</p>
<div><strong>Floppy disk image formats</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Sector dump format (also known as "v9t9" format)</li>
<li>Track dump format (aka "PC99" format)</li>
<li>HFE format (aka "Lotharek" format)</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Hard disk image formats</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Raw hard disk format (same as sector dump format but for hard disks)</li>
<li>MAME CHD format (Compressed Hunks of Data, a MAME-specific format for mass storage media)</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>Compact flash format</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>CF7 image format (whole card)</li>
<li>CF7 volume format (single volume on the CF7 image)</li>
</ul>

<p>All these formats can be used directly, including reading and writing operations.
Files and directories may be moved or copied between images of different formats.
The different formats are only visible to some lower layer of TIImageTool and 
are not visible to the user. There are no constraints beyond those that are
specific for the device (e.g. you cannot create more than three directories 
on a floppy disk).</p>

<a name="license"></a>
<h2>Licensing</h2>
<p>Usage of TIImageTool is subject to the <span class="imp">GPLv3</span> license. The terms of the 
license can be found inside the distribution package file that contained this JAR file. 
The package also contains the source code as required by the GPL license. 
The GPL license text can also be downloaded
from <span class="imp">www.gnu.org</span>. In essence, you can redistribute
or change the software to your needs, but only if you put your modifications
under the same GPLv3 license. In doubt, contact the above E-Mail address,
also for dual licensing considerations.</p>

<a name="bugs"></a>
<h2>Bugs and errors</h2>
<p>Although everyone does his or her best, to err remains human. Every new
release of TIImageTool has added a set of new features, everything certainly
tested several times in different ways. But it is just impossible to
ensure that everything works as expected.</p>
<p>So if you find something weird going on with TIImageTool, here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably the program works correctly, and you just understood one 
of its functions in a different way. Read the appropriate section of this manual, 
or contact me by mail (see below).</li>
<li>If you encounter trouble while writing on your images, make sure your images are not
write-protected.</li>
<li>If the program seems to hang (mouse pointer shows a "wait state"), check if
some dialog window waits for your input. If not, you should restart the program
in a command line. Watch if there is some output in 
the command line which reads like an error message and report it to me.
You can also activate the console output logging to a file, and open the 
console window in the Utility menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, if you need help please contact me at <strong>ti99@mizapf.de</strong>. 
The more detailed your problem description is, the easier it is for me to
track the source of the issue. Tell me exactly what you did when the problem
occured, or even better, try to reproduce the problem. Just do not try to 
silently get along with it.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions</strong> are always welcome. Also tell me if some program behavior
is obviously correct as described but feels surprising, awkward, or not useful for you. 
I cannot promise to consider all of your inputs but if your point convinces me
there is a good chance you'll get in the next version.</p>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Single-sided TDF format images differ from PC99 images. If you intend to 
create images for the PC99 emulator, only use double-sided images.</li>
<li>When pasting fails during a move operation on the same medium, the file
may be lost. Copying and deleting afterwards is safer.</li>
</ul>

<a name="disclaimer"></a>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>TIImageTool has been created by myself without rigorous
testing and without verification against any formal tests or test suites. The
program may contain errors which may prevent it from functioning in a promised
or expected way. Even worse, as the core features of the program comprise 
file management, any malfunction may render image files useless after using this
tool. As I am using this tool by myself, you can feel reassured that I do not
plan to purposefully break the images, as my own ones would also be lost.</p>

<p class="warn">Although care has been taken
to ensure a safe working with images, you should always keep backup copies 
of your media. As long as you only read files with this tool your images
remain unchanged.</p>

<a name="comments"></a>
<h2>Comments from the author</h2>
<p>My motivation for writing TIImageTool emerged when I managed to copy all 
of my old TI floppy disks to PC image files in order to use them in MESS
(today MAME). At that point I was in need of a tool which allowed 
me to quickly check whether all images have been correctly
copied. MAME offers a tool named <em>imgtool</em>, but it is a text-only 
command line tool, and its main use case seems the creation of new images. 
After I added the track dump format
to the TI-99 emulation in MAME, I should have added that support to imgtool as
well. imgtool is a good tool if you are working with many different emulations
in MAME, but it cannot cover all features that one would like to have for one 
specific platform.</p>

<p>I started with TIImageTool in 2010, first as a pure command 
line tool. Later I added a graphical user interface. During the following years
I added more and more features, like multi-disk support and cut-copy-paste 
capabilities, hard disk operations, and archive support.</p> 
<p>TIImageTool is a single-person project, done in my free time. 
I wrote it completely in Java using the <em>jEdit</em> 
editor as my favorite programming environment (small, fast, useful). The 
background image was created by using <em>GIMP</em>, based on
a screenshot of the Master Title Screen.</p>

<hr>

<a name="usage"></a>
<h2>General usage</h2>
<p>As the most typical use case, you open one or more image files by the open 
function in the file menu and view, move, copy, or save files stored inside those images. </p>
<p>When an image is loaded, its contents are displayed in an own <strong>tab</strong>
in a format similar to the directory displays known from the TI or Geneve. You can
open more than one image, and each image gets its own tab. You can also open an
image more than once for a comfortable file transfer on the same image. 
File operations may involve a single tab, but also another tab, when you copy
or move files from one image to another. You can open an image more than
once, hence getting multiple tabs for the same image.
<p>Tabs may be <strong>detached</strong> from the main window, which means 
they are shown as separate windows. When you close the detached windows, they 
again become tabs of the main window, unless you close the main window, 
which shuts down all open windows at once. Using different windows makes it
easy to copy or move files, using the drag-and-drop feature. In general, 
we call a directory listing of an image a <strong>view</strong>. 
Using this terminology we can say that views can appear as tabs of the main window, or as separate windows.</p>

<p>Within the directory content display you can open files by <strong>double-clicking</strong>
the left mouse button over the entry. TIImageTool will choose a suitable display format (text 
for DIS/VAR 80 files, program listing for BASIC). In order to step into a 
subdirectory, double-click its name in the display; to get back, double-click the
parent directory entry ("..").</p>
<p>All file operations require that you <strong>select</strong> one or more
files. Selection is done in the usual way by moving the mouse pointer over an
entry and by left-clicking on it (marking it). If you want to do single file operations 
you do not need to mark the file first; you can immediately double-click it 
or click the right mouse button to let the <strong>context menu</strong> show up.</p>
<p>Selection of multiple files or directories is done by left-clicking while
pressing the <strong>Shift</strong> or <strong>Ctrl</strong> key on the keyboard.
The Shift key allows you to select a range (starting at the last selected entry)
while Ctrl is used for separate selections.</p>
<p>Available operations depend on the selected entries. For instance, if you
select multiple text files you can open each one of them in one go. If you select
a BASIC file and a text file together, however, there are less options because
you cannot list a text file. The program determines which options may be reasonable
to use for the current selection.</p>
<p>According to the available operations, menu items become selectable or 
become deactivated. For instance, the <em>close</em> menu option is only available if
an image has been opened.</p>
<p>Many operations are available via the <strong>context menu</strong>. This
menu is shown when you right-click a directory entry (right mouse button) or when
you right-click on a free space on the directory tab. All this is done in a
way which should be quite familiar for people using modern operating systems 
like Linux, MacOS, or Windows.</p>

<p>All operations are performed <strong>immediately</strong> on the image. 
There is <strong>no undo</strong> feature in TIImageTool yet. One exception
is the sector editor where all changes are kept in memory until they
are explicitly copied to disk.</p> 

<a name="draganddrop"></a>
<h2>Dragging and dropping</h2>
<p>With the <strong>Drag-and-Drop support</strong> (DnD) you can easily move or copy files between images, between directories,
or even between an image and the PC file system and vice versa. The DnD support is based on the DnD implementation in Java Swing. It implements
all common gestures, but has some few limitations that you should be aware of.</p>
<p>In most cases, DnD is simply done by clicking on a file, holding the mouse
button while moving the pointer to a target area, and then releasing the button.</p>
<p><strong>Moving</strong> is the default operation in TIImageTool. This
means that after the operation, the file is added to the target image (where you
released the mouse button), and it is removed from the image from where you
dragged the file away.</p>
<p><strong>Copying</strong> is what you may want to do in almost the same number
of times. You can specify that the DnD gesture means copying by pressing and holding the
<strong>Ctrl</strong> button on the keyboard when you drop the file. In this 
case, the file will not be removed from its origin.</p>
<p>You can copy single files, but also a set of files from a single view. For this
purpose you must mark the files as already described above (left-clicking, 
together with Shift or Ctrl keys) and then drag them to the target view.</p>
<p>We're not done yet. You can also copy directories; they behave in the same
way as your files. One exception though, you cannot drag a directory into another
directory on a floppy disk, since the floppy disk file system does not support
nested directories.</p>
<p>Finally, what happens when you pull your file out of TIImageTool? - 
This will be handled as an <strong>export</strong> operation, and also here,
you can select multiple files or directories and export them in one go. The exported files
will appear as TIFILES files in the PC file system.</p>
<p>The opposite direction means <strong>importing</strong>, and you can achieve it
using DnD by dragging a file from the PC file system into TIImageTool. If the
file to be imported is a TIFILES file, all file metadata are retrieved and
automatically set for the newly imported file. If the file is a plain binary file
or a text file, you will be asked for the missing information. Maybe you should
just try it before I try to explain it with a lot of words.</p>
<p>One limitation of the export feature is that you can only <em>copy</em> files and
directories from the image file to the external file system; <em>moving</em> is not
possible even though your file explorer will offer you the option to move. This
is a limitation of the Java DnD support.</p>

<p>You find more details about import and export <a href="#importf">below</a>.</p>


<a name="context"></a>
<h2>Context menu functions</h2>

<p>The context menu pops up when you click the right mouse button over an 
entry of the directory. The set of active selections depends on the selection:
For instance, when you click on a BASIC file, the option to <em>List BASIC</em>
becomes active.</p>
<p>You can also click in the free space below the last file; this will open 
a context menu for the volume itself, which contains items to create new
files or directories, or to paste copied files into this directory.</p>

<a name="diskimages"></a>
<h2>Floppy disk image handling</h2>
<p>Floppy disk images represent real floppy disks and contain files just as
their real counterparts. Floppy images are stored in a specific format. MAME and TIImageTool support
two formats known as the <em>Sector Dump Format</em> and the <em>Track Dump
Format</em>; other names are <em>v9t9</em> and <em>pc99</em> format, according
to the name of the emulators which first used them.</p> 

<p>With the introduction of the HFDC controller, the 
floppy file system was enhanced by directories, but we can only have 3
directories at root level. Also, directories cannot be nested.</p>

<p>TIImageTool does not allow for creating disk images from a real floppy disk
at this time. This requires a low-level access to the floppy controller on the
PC board. You can, however, transfer files using <a href="#importr">XModem</a>.</p>

<p>Disk images can be created with or without a file system within TIImageTool.</p>

<a name="newfl"></a>
<h4>New</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>Allows you to create new floppy disk images. You can decide between 
pre-formatted and blank image files.</p>
<p>Floppy image files may be created as sector images (v9t9), track images
(pc99), or HFE images (Lotharek).</p> 
<p>You have to choose a file name for the new image. If you create a sector dump
format image (SDF), the file suffix "dsk" is appended (unless you provided it
already). Track dump format files get a "dtk" suffix; HFE files get a "hfe"
suffix.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Disk name</em>: <a href="#valid">Valid</a> disk names are at most 10 characters long; the period
character "." is not allowed.</li>
<li><em>Image type</em>: Choose between Sector Dump Format (v9t9), Track Dump Format (pc99), and HFE Image (Lotharek)</li>
<li><em>Formatting</em>: If you create a blank image you need to format it within the emulator before you can use
it in TIImageTool.</li>
<li><em>Sides, Density, tracks</em>: Parameters which determine the capacity of the image.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Formatted images are automatically opened after creation.</p>

<p>The most often used format is 360 KiB (double-sided, double density, 40
tracks). While high and ultra density disks are supported by the HFDC <a href="#DSR">DSR</a>, 
the real HFDC card cannot reliably deal with the higher data rates. You may
find descriptions on the Web how to upgrade the hardware to work with these formats.</p>

<p>The Sector Dump Format is recommended for common use.</p>

<a name="open"></a>
<h4>Open</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>This feature allows you to open an image and display its contents in a 
new tab in the program window. As stated in the <a href="#formats">formats</a>
section, floppy disk images in SDF and TDF format are supported. Also, hard disk
images in RAW and CHD format may be used. It is not required to extract the
CHD contents before using in TIImageTool, and modifications to the image
are properly written into the CHD file.</p>
<p>Unlike prior releases of TIImageTool, you can open an image more than once.
Any change you commit to one of the copies is reflected in all others 
immediately.</p>
</div>

<p>The "Open recent" feature considerably speeds up your work when you usually
use a limited set of different images.</p>

<h4>Open recent file</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>In the <strong>Open recent file</strong> menu item you can find the most recent
10 image file names in a list.</p>
</div>

<p>You can close the currently selected image in several ways.</p>

<a name="close"></a>
<h4>Close / close all</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>This option closes the currently selected view (or all views). Remember that
changes to the image have already been performed when you operated on the image,
hence closing is not necessary to commit previous changes. You can also close tabs 
using the <strong>close button</strong> on the tab (and I bet you'll use that one).</p>

<h2>Hard disk image handling</h2>
<p>Hard disks images can be used in MAME just like floppy disk images, but they
are usually much bigger due to their higher storage capacity.</p>

<p>MAME uses a special container for hard disk images called CHD (<em>Compressed 
Hunks of Data</em>). TIImageTool allows for working with plain contents as 
well as with these CHD containers. You can find all kinds of operations 
like creating, extracting, or modifying the CHD container within 
the menu functions.</p>

<p>Also, two file systems are supported: the HFDC and the SCSI file system. The 
difference between both is that the SCSI file system does not contain information
about cylinders, heads, and sectors per track, because SCSI drives provide a 
linear block addressing.</p>

<h3>Raw images</h3>
<p>Raw images are simply sector dump images as found with the floppy disks; they consist
of a sequence of sector contents, starting with sector 0 and going up to the 
last sector. Raw images do not contain information about the drive parameters
(how may cylinders, heads, and sectors per track are used) except for the 
information in sector 0 after the hard disk has been properly formatted.</p>

<p>MAME cannot handle raw images because it must be able to determine the drive 
parameters from unformatted drives as well. These parameters are available in the
CHD format.</p>
<p>When you attach your TI or Geneve SCSI hard disk to a SCSI adapter in a PC,
you can read the raw data and produce a raw image, even though the PC does not
know anything about the TI file systems. In Linux you can use the <strong>dd</strong>
command:</p>

<pre>
dd if=/dev/sdX of=imagefile.raw bs=4096
</pre>

<p>You must, of course, use the appropriate device name (not sdX) which is
assigned to that drive. In Linux you can use this "raw" device (e.g. sda, sdb, ...)
when you want to access the device outside of any disk partitioning. The <em>bs</em>
parameter declares the block size in bytes, which may be set to 256 as the 
real sector size, but using a higher value speeds up the copy process (multiple
sectors will be read in one go).</p>

<p>You can read more about working with external devices in the section 
<a href="#cf7handling">Compact Flash handling</a>.</p>

<h3>MAME CHD</h3>
<p>CHD means <em>Compressed Hunks of Data</em> which implies one of its 
original uses: to allow to pack contents of mass storage media in a comparably 
small container. CHD is not only intended for hard disk images, but also for CD-ROMs,
tapes, and others. The CHD container not only allows for compressing the contents,
but also for checking their integrity with CRC and SHA1 hash values.</p>
<p>For working hard disks, neither compression nor hash values can be used, because
their contents are changing over time; only if a hard disk contains a fixed
content these properties are useful. Apart from that, the CHD container adds 
important information about the drive geometry (cylinders, heads,
sectors per track).</p>

<p>CHD has evolved along many versions; the current version is 5. It introduced
a very useful feature: The size of the image can be minimized even without 
compressing. All tracks that are completely filled with 0 are not stored. There
is a map at the beginning of the container, and when the system looks up the
pointer to a desired track and gets a 0, it automatically creates an empty 
track image filled with zeros.</p>

<p>You can also extract the contents of a CHD container into a raw image; you
will need this when you want to write contents back to your real TI/Geneve hard drive.
Vice versa, you can import raw contents and create a new CHD container. On this
occasion, you can specify whether you want unallocated space to be filled with
zeros. As said above, this may greatly reduce the size of your image.</p>

<p>When you create a blank hard disk with MAME tools or with TIImageTool without
formatting, you must format it inside the emulation (e.g. with the 
<em>Myarc Disk Manager</em>). However, after formatting the CHD container will
have grown to the maximum size, so the CHD format may not utilize its space-saving
feature. The reason is that the Disk Manager writes test patterns on the hard 
disk which the CHD does not know about, so it assumes that these patterns are
user data. This can be "fixed" by TIImageTool which can convert this test 
pattern to zeros if the respective sectors on the hard disks
are not allocated for files.</p>

<h3>Hard disk parameters</h3>
<p>There are two groups of parameters for hard disk usage: the geometry, and 
technical parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Geometry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cylinders</em>: Basically the same as "tracks" for floppy disks, with
the exception that a cylinder is the set of all tracks (from each head) at the
same distance from the spindle. The number of cylinders is determined
by the mechanical properties of the drive, so each drive has its specific count 
of cylinders. The number of cylinders is typically indicated on the case of the drive. The once
famous ST-225 drive from Seagate has 615 cylinders, which is used as a default
in TIImageTool. You can define <strong>up to 2048</strong> cylinders.
</li>
<li><em>Heads</em>: For floppy drives we usually talk about <em>sides</em>, but
again, we have multiple disks in a hard disk case, so there are also multiple
heads. You can have <strong>up to 16</strong> heads, and in this program we
also require their number to be even (always using both sides of a disk).</li>
<li><em>Sectors per track</em>: On floppy disks, sectors could be defined at any
location on the track (<em>soft-sectored</em>), but hard disks may be designed to
have sectors at specific locations. Therefore the number of sectors per track
can be considered as defined by its geometry. We can have <strong>up to 256</strong> sectors per track, 
but commonly we find 32 sectors per track.</li>
<li><em>Sector length</em>: This is rather a matter of formatting, not of
specific geometric constraints. Sector lengths for MFM drives and SCSI drives 
as used in the TI/Geneve environments are always <strong>256 bytes</strong>.
Only the IDE drives as used with the IDE adapter are created with 512 bytes as
commonly used in the PC world, but this is not yet supported in TIImageTool.</li>
</ul>

<p>SCSI drives do not expose these geometric data to the outside world, other
than MFM drives which were used with the HFDC controller. SCSI drives only define
a number of sectors and care for locating them inside their own control logic.
Accordingly, we have a variation of the hard disk file system on the TI/Geneve
which we call <em>SCSI file system</em>; it only differs in the first sector
where the geometry data and technical parameters are left blank.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced options</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reserved AUs</em>: The root directory is located in the low sector numbers,
near the beginning. It is reasonable to reserve a set of allocation units for this 
directory to avoid that it becomes fragmented.</li>
<li><em>Write precompensation</em>: Sectors near the center are packed tighter,
and therefore some fractions of microseconds
of time shifting in writing is required to make the recording reliable. Again,
the value is guessed, and you can leave it this way.</li>
<li><em>Reduced write current</em>: Inner sectors on the drive disk are closer
together, so the current sent to the write head should be reduced to avoid 
modifying the neighboring sectors. MFM and RLL drives were set to a lower write
current by a special control line, and the controller had to be told from where to
use the lower current. We use a guessed value here, determined from the default
values as used in Myarc Disk Manager. You should be safe to leave the value as is.</li>
<li><em>Step speed</em>: As the name implies, defines the step rate of the heads
in the drive. Can be set in a range of 0-7 and depends on the mechanics of the drive.</li>
<li><em>File system</em>: You can choose between HFDC and SCSI, but as already
stated, MAME currently does not support SCSI.</li>
<li><em>Buffered step</em>: Some drives were able to buffer step pulses for their
heads, so the controller was not required to do single steps but to output a sequence
of step pulses, and then listened to a line called <em>seek complete</em>. The
default is true, since only very old drives came without buffered steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these technical parameters may be safely left with their defaults. The only
thing that you have to consider is that the size of the hard disk matches the
declared parameters in the file system (in sector 0). You cannot use hard disks
beyond the size of 248 MiB because of the size of the allocation table in the file
system which has a size of 31 sectors.</p>

<a name="newhd"></a>
<h4>New</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>Allows you to create
new hard disk images. You have to define the geometry of the disk and you can 
decide between pre-formatted and blank image files.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Volume name</em>: Specify a <a href="#valid">valid</a> volume name.</li>
<li><em>Cylinders, heads, sectors</em>: Geometry parameters. You must define them
even when you plan to create a SCSI image. This is required for the MAME CHD container.</li>
<li><em>Sector length</em>: For HFDC and SCSI, the sector length must be 256. In a
later revision there may be support for IDE drives with 512 bytes per sector.</li>
<li><em>Format hard disk</em>: Create the file system on the image. If you want
to use an emulation-internal tool for formatting, uncheck the box.</li>
<li><em>Advanced options</em>: Activating this box unfolds a set of detail
options which you may want to set. However, for most situations, you should leave
the default values unchanged.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Note that when you let TIImageTool format the hard disk image, the CHD 
container can be minimized in size, as the free space is filled with zeros. Thus, 
the formatted image is <strong>much smaller</strong> if you use this format option, compared
to the fully expanded size which you will find after formatting with Myarc Disk Manager
within the emulation.</p>

<h4>Open / Close</h4>
<div class="program">
For opening and closing a hard disk image see the respective <a href="#open">section</a> for floppies.
</div>

<a name="chdformat"></a>
<h3>Upgrading or downgrading the CHD format</h3>
<p>You can use this function to upgrade your old CHD image from 4 to 5. You can
also downgrade the container, although this is only recommended when you use
it with an old MAME version.</p>

<h4>Change CHD Format</h4>
<div class="program">
<p><em>Convert to version</em>: Specify the new CHD version. The default is 5.
If you downgrade (from 5 to 4) you will get a warning notice.</p>
</div>

<p>You can always cancel the operation before any change takes place.</p>
<p>If you leave the version as is, no operation will be performed. If you intend
to optimize the size of the v5 container you should <a href="#chdraw">extract</a>
and <a href="#rawchd">re-import</a> the contents again.</p>

<a name="chdraw"></a>
<h3>Extracting contents from a CHD container</h3>
<p>Extracting is pretty simple, as the target format (the sector contents) does
not need any parameters. Note that CHD
containers may be much smaller than the size they represent. The extracted content
will expand to the full size. Make sure you have enough space on your file system.</p>
<p>Extraction will not be done on the currently open image, but you have to 
choose an image file from your file system.</p>

<h4>Extract raw from CHD</h4>
<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>File name for CHD image (from)</em>: Specify the CHD container from which you want to extract
the contents.</li>
<li><em>File name for raw contents (to)</em>: Specify the file name that will 
be used for the contents of the hard disk image.</li>
<li><em>Export size will be</em>: Tells you how much space this extraction will require.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<a name="rawchd"></a>
<h3>Importing contents into a new CHD container</h3>
<p>Importing requires some information that is not contained in the raw contents.
This information (the <em>metadata</em>) inform MAME about the geometry of the
drive even when it is not formatted yet. As above, you do not operate on the currently open images.</p>

<h4>Import from raw</h4>
<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>File name for raw contents (from)</em>: Specify the raw file which contains
the sector contents.</li>
<li><em>File name for CHD image (to)</em>: Specify the new CHD file that will
receive the contents of the raw file.</li>
<li><em>Fill unallocated space with zeros</em>: Tracks filled with zeros are not
stored in a CHD container; this may allow the container to shrink considerably.</li>
<li><em>Target parameters</em>: You cannot change these parameters. They are 
computed from the size of the input file.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The new CHD container is stored on the PC drive, but it is not automatically 
opened. You can open it <a href="#open">as usual</a>.</p>

<p>The CHD container may be <strong>much smaller</strong> than you expected.
CHD containers do not store tracks which are filled with zeros. However, if you
format the drive within the emulation, test patterns will make the CHD expand to 
its full size.</p>
<p>When you import raw data into a new CHD, TIImageTool fetches the geometry values
from sector 0. If the raw image has a SCSI file system, we need to guess proper
geometry values. This should not cause any problems, as there are no checks
for known geometries. However, keep in mind that you cannot use SCSI images
in MAME at this time (version 0.179).</p>

<h3>Converting between HFDC and SCSI file system</h3>
<p>You can change the file system from SCSI to HFDC and back. You will lose the
geometry and technical parameters when you convert it to SCSI, and you have to
define them when you convert to HFDC.</p>
<p>Changing the file system is possible with raw images, but not with CHD images.
The reason is that when you change the parameters, the CHD information may
become inconsistent. You have two ways to handle this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new HFDC-formatted image and copy the contents from the raw SCSI image.</li>
<li>Extract the raw contents from the CHD (if you have already imported them), change the file system,
and import them again into a new CHD.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Convert to HFDC</strong></p>
<p>The volume information block (VIB) of a hard disk image differs between HFDC and
SCSI systems: For the HFDC, the VIB contains cylinder/head/sector information
(the disk geometry); SCSI file systems use a linear block addressing and therefore
do not define a geometry. Converting to HFDC means that you have to supply the
geometry data by yourself.</p>

<a name="hfdc"></a>
<h4>Define geometry</h4>
<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>Cylinders, heads, ...</em>: These values are guessed from
the raw data. You may want to provide other data here.</li>
</ul>
<p>The suggestions are a guess from the program which would result in a hard disk of the 
size of the raw data.</p>
</div>

<p>TIImageTool tries to guess reasonable values for the drive geometry from
the size of the image. SCSI drives, however, usually reserve a set of sectors
for replacing defect sectors, so the number of sectors is less than should be
expected from calculating the number by multiplying cylinders, heads, and sectors
per track. We assume that we have 32 sectors per track and round up to the next
multiple of 512 sectors. This allows us to cleanly divide the total sector number into
the geometry values. If you know different values you can change them manually.</p>

<p>This function also checks for <em>invalid MaxAU</em> values. These invalid values 
are caused by a bug of a formatter in earlier GeneveOS versions. When found, the
program will replace all of these values by the correct maximum value.</p>

<p>Converting to HFDC is required only if you want to use a SCSI image with the HFDC. 
For current MAME versions, only the HFDC controller is emulated. Later MAME
versions may include a SCSI emulation so that this conversion may become
obsolete.</p>

<p><strong>Convert to SCSI</strong></p>
<p>This is the inverse process to the conversion to HFDC. Here the geometry
data are discarded. This may be necessary when you want to write an image back to a SCSI
drive and continue to use it by a real SCSI controller (ASCSI or WHTech) attached
to your TI or Geneve.</p>

<a name="scsi"></a>
<h4>Notifications</h4>
<div class="program">
You may get one of these notifications.
<ul>
<li><em>Cannot convert the image within the CHD container</em>: You cannot convert an image within the CHD
container because this may have an effect on the geometry of the drive. You
must first <a href="#chdraw">extract</a> the raw contents and apply this 
function on the raw contents.</li>
<li><em>This will remove the CHS information</em>: You are about to clear the
fields within the raw data. You will not have a direct chance of undoing, so you
should be certain what you are about to do.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The conversion completes silently, and you will notice the effect when you
see that the heading contains the line <em>Directory of SCS1</em>.</p>

<h2>Compact Flash handling</h2>
<p>Compact Flash cards offer a high storage capacity in a small casing, at 
least compared to conventional hard disk drives and floppy disks. Nowadays,
CF cards are getting rarer because SD cards have become superior in capacity,
performance, and handling.</p>
<p>CF cards are nevertheless interesting for TI users, since there is a peripheral
device that has gained much popularity, the <em>nanoPEB</em>. It makes use of
a CF card to emulate a floppy drive (or even several of them) by defining
a set of <em>volumes</em> that can be mounted as desired and which appears
as a floppy disk for the TI system.</p>

<a name="cf7gen"></a>
<h3>General considerations</h3>
<p>CF cards come in various sizes - from 128 MiB, to 512 MiB, 1 or several GiB.
However, only in rare cases the CF cards provide the amount of memory printed
on their casing. This is because a certain portion of the memory is retained
for replacing defect sectors. This has some ugly consequences. If we have 256 MiB image file, it is not
certain whether it can be written on a 256 MiB card. This also means that
we may fail to copy a 256 MiB card to another one of the (seemingly) same size.</p>
<p>For this reason, the typical approach for creating new images is not 
recommended here. For instance, if we create a 256 MiB image to be later written
on a CF card, we may find out that it won't fit. Instead, we set up a 
different way: </p>
<ul>
<li>First download the contents of an existing CF card and store them as an image file.</li>
<li>Then modify its contents as desired.</li>
<li>Finally write back the image to the CF card.</li>
</ul>
</p>The job of transferring the data from or to the device is done by an external program: <strong>dd</strong>. While dd is part
of all Linux distributions and also of MacOS, Windows users will not find it
on their drives. You have to download <strong>dd for Windows</strong> from the web; as of 2016, the address
is <a href="http://www.chrysocome.net/dd">http://www.chrysocome.net/dd</a>.</p>

<p>Linux does not allow a normal user to directly access the CF card device. 
In order to get the required privileges, Linux systems must run the
dd command as root, and this can be achieved by a special command before.
In a shell this command is known as <strong>sudo</strong>, but we need the
corresponding command for the graphical desktop:</p>

<ul>
<li>KDE: The command is <strong>kdesu</strong>.</li>
<li>Gnome: The command is <strong>gksu</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MacOS</strong> offers a similar concept by the command <strong>osascript</strong>
(thanks to Henrik Wedekind for donating these lines to TIImageTool).
After copying the CF contents to the local filesystem, we have to change
the ownership of the file, as it still belongs to root. That is, a <strong>chown</strong>
command is executed at last.</p>

<p>In <strong>Windows</strong>, no privilege escalation is required, so there is nothing
like kdesu, gksu, osascript, or chown that you have to deal with.</p>

<p>The paths for all of these commands can be set in the <a href="#pref">Preferences</a>.</p>

<p>If everything worked correctly, you should have got a file with the
complete contents of the CF card. Note that we did not yet talk about the 
CF7 format - the contents of the CF card are plainly copied, so they may
have any format or just none. If this image represents a CF7 card, you can now open this file with the
usual <a href="#open">open</a> operation. The same is true for a HFDC or SCSI
backup. If the contents are not recognized, you have to format one or more
CF7 volumes to make use of them.</p>

<p>After working on the file, you should write it back on the CF card so that
the card can be used in the nanoPEB. Writing is done again with the <strong>dd</strong>
command, so be sure you entered the correct drive letter of your CF card.
<strong>Double-check the drive letter!</strong> If you accidentally use a drive letter that is assigned
to one of your hard disk drives, you will erase its contents and possibly
destroy your PC installation.</p>

<h3>Using CF cards as a hard drive</h3>
<p>Although CF cards usually offer far too much space to be used for a 
TI file system, we can make use of them as cheap and handy backup media. Maybe
you also have a way to connect a CF card to your TI system by some expansion
card.</p>

<p>In this situation, you just need to copy the CF contents to an image file. 
For example, your CF card is accessible as drive <strong>e:</strong> in 
Windows (your situation may be different) or as a device
<strong>/dev/sdc</strong> in Linux, and the target image file should be <strong>cfcopy.raw</strong>
in your PC file system. After reading, you can <a href="#open">open</a> the cfcopy.raw file in TIImageTool
with open and perform all desired operations.</p>

<p>When you are done with editing, you just need to write the image file (here <strong>cfcopy.raw</strong>)
back to the CF card.</p>

<h3>Using CF7-formatted cards</h3>

<p>CF7-formatted CF cards consist of a sequence of <strong>volumes</strong>,
each representing a virtual floppy disk with 400 KiB size (1600 sectors). 
The nanoPEB allows the user to mount one volume per virtual disk drive, where
the volumes are enumerated from 1 to a maximum number, determined by the 
size of the card. That is, volume 1 occupies the first 400 KiB, volume 2
occupies the next 400 KiB, and so on until the space is exhausted.</p>
<p>Volumes must be formatted before they can be used, similar to the other
media like floppy disks and hard disks. It is not necessary to format all
volumes on the card, however. Since all volumes are 400 KiB in size, there
is no reason why we would have to format all preceding volumes to be able
to open the next one.</p>
<p>There is one exception. For TIImageTool to be able to determine the format,
volume 1 must be formatted. If not, you cannot open the CF7 image; this 
can be easily fixed by formatting the first volume.</p>
<p>Volumes may be stored as <strong>separate dsk files</strong>, and as such
they share their format with the sector dumps of floppy disks, with the exception
that they have 1600 sectors. Apart from that, they just behave like a floppy
disk image, but you cannot create directories on them.</p>
<p>Separate volumes are not really needed when you work with TIImageTool: You
can always open a volume inside a CF7 card without having to extract it to
a file. However, the nanoPEB device provides two utility programs to handle
such separate volumes: <strong>cf2dsk.exe</strong> copies a volume to a
separate file, while <strong>dsk2cf.exe</strong> imports a volume from a
separate file into a CF card. So if you have a CF7 device like the nanoPEB,
you may have those separate volumes, and you should be able to work with
them with TIImageTool.</p>
<p>Another advantage of separate volumes is that you can easily send them
to other users by E-mail or upload them to a server - without the need to send your complete CF7 image.</p>

<a name="newcf7"></a>
<h4>New CF7 volume</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>Allows you to create a new, separate CF7 volume.</p> 
<li><em>Volume name</em>: <a href="#valid">Valid</a> disk names are at most 10 characters long; the period
character "." is not allowed.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Formatted volumes are automatically opened after creation. Please keep in mind
that at this point, a separate volume does not belong to a CF7 image yet. There
is no particular function to import a volume into a CF7 image, but it is
quite easy to achieve this with the common TIImageTool operations: Just open the separate
volume and the target CF7 image, and copy and paste all files from one to another.</p>

<p>You may be surprised by this one:</p>

<h4>New CF7 image</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>Does <em>not</em> allow you to create a new CF7 image. Instead, you should 
use the functions that are available in the <em>Utility menu</em>.</p>
</ul>
</div>

<p>For an explanation see the section on <a href="#cf7gen">general considerations</a>.

<p>Concerning CF7 cards, there are two situations to be distinguished. When you
attempt to <em>open a CF7 volume</em>, it is opened just like any other floppy
image. When you attempt to open a <em>CF7 image</em> which represents the whole
CF card, you have to specify which volume you are interested in. A dialog
window is displayed which shows the available, formatted volumes in this image.
</p>

<a name="open"></a>
<h4>Open</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>(CF7 volume) Opens a separate CF7 volume in a new tab.</p>
<p>(CF7 image) Presents a list of defined, formatted volumes of this image
file, then opens the volume that you select by single click and Return, or
by double click.</p> 
</div>

<p>For each open operation you can only select one volume to be opened, since
there is no multi-item selection capability in this dialog. You can, however, 
repeat the open action and open one more volume each time.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="files"></a>
<h2>File management</h2>
<p>File management in TIImageTool is widely done in the same way as you know 
it from working with PC file systems. Files can be <em>moved</em> (removed from the original location and
put at the new one), <em>copied</em> (created at the new location without deleting
it at the origin), <em>deleted</em> (removed, no way to undo the operation), or
<em>renamed</em> (staying at the same location).</p>

<a name="select"></a>
<h3>Selecting</h3>
<p>One important thing to know is how to determine on which files the operation
shall be applied. To specify you must select the files by a single click.
</p>
<p>You can select a single file by moving the mouse pointer over the entry in the
directory list and clicking the left mouse button. Pressing <strong>Shift</strong> while clicking the
left mouse button, you can select a range of entries, while the <strong>Ctrl</strong>
key allows you to add a file to the current selection. You can deselect files
by clicking on them a second time (holding the Ctrl key). If you left-click on
any item without holding one of these keys, the current selection will be canceled.
</p>
<p>You can work with directories in the same way - directories can be selected
to be moved, renamed, and so on.</p>

<a name="selectall"></a>
<h3>Select all</h3>
<p>Sometimes you may need to select all files; you can do this my selecting the
first entry at the top and selecting the last one at the bottom, pushing Shift
this time. Or you use this menu function. You can also select the whole contents using
the <strong>Ctrl-A</strong> key combination.
</p>

<h3>File operations</h3>
<p>These functions allow you to modify the image contents by moving, copying,
and deleting entries of the directories. They work pretty much like the well-known
functions which are available in many other programs.</p>

<a name="cut"></a>
<h4>Cut / copy / paste / delete</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>These functions are established ways to operate on files in directories. You 
can <a href="#select">select</a> one or multiple files or directories, or both.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Cut</em>: Marks a file for moving. Unless <em>paste</em> is selected, 
nothing happens. In order to remind you of the cutting action, entries that have
been cut are marked by a lighter text color.</li>
<li><em>Copy</em>: Marks a file for copying. Again, nothing happens until you
paste the file to its new destination. Files that are marked for copying are not
specially highlighted.</li>
<li><em>Paste</em>: Completes the cut/copy operation. The selected file(s) and 
directory(s) are inserted into the currently open and selected directory. Also,
when cut was selected, they are removed at their origin.</li>
<li><em>Delete</em>: Removes the selected file(s) and directory(s). There is no
way to restore them, so you have to approve the action in a confirmation dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the well-known <em>shortcuts</em>: <strong>Ctrl-C</strong>
for copy, <strong>Ctrl-V</strong> for paste, <strong>Ctrl-X</strong> for cut, <strong>Del</strong> for delete.
</p>
</div>

<p>Moving files on the same image does not move the file contents. It only moves
the file into another directory. Moving to another image, instead, first copies the
file, then deletes the file on the original image. When you copy or move 
a file or directory to a directory where there is already a file or directory of
the same name, you will be asked to choose another name.</p>
<p>Moving or copying directories applies to the complete subtree of this directory.
This means that when you copy a directory to another image, the complete 
contents will be copied as well.</p>

<a name="rename"></a>
<p>Files and directories can be renamed.</p>

<h4>Rename</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>If you select multiple files or directories, this function is iteratively
performed for each one.</p>
<p>
<em>New name</em>: Provide a <a href="#valid">valid</a> name. There is no auto-renaming scheme. The
input is checked for validity and whether the name is already used.</p>
</div>

<p>You will notice that after renaming the contents will appear re-sorted. The TI file
systems use sorted lists of files and directories, so it is an error if the
list is not displayed as sorted.</p>

<h3>New directory</h3>
<p>Hard disks and also floppy disks may have directories to structure their
content. Floppy disks are constrained to have at most three directories, and
they must reside in the root directory of the file system. This means you cannot
create a directory inside another
directory when you are working with floppy images. On hard disks, these restrictions
do not apply. You can have up to 114 subdirectories in a directory.</p>

<a name="newdir"></a>
<h4>New directory</h4>
<div class="program">
<p><em>Directory name</em>: Provide a <a href="#valid">valid</a> name. The
input is checked for validity and whether the name is not already used. The new
directory is created in the currently shown directory.</p>
</div>

<p>The menu function and the context menu function are deactivated when you
are not allowed to create a new directory at this point.</p>

<a name="archiving"></a>
<h2>Archiver support</h2>
<p>Barry Boone's <em>Archiver</em> is the standard tool for packing files on 
a TI or Geneve. Archiver works similar to the <em>tar</em> program; it concatenates
all file contents in a single file, including the metadata of the files (file
names, types, and other information). Archiver offers the option to compress the
whole package using LZW compression. Archiver does not allow for storing directories
and can only pack files from a single directory. It does not store path information.
</p>
<p>Uncompressed archive files have file type DIS/FIX 128, while compressed 
archives can be recognized by their INT/FIX 128 file type.</p>

<p>TIImageTool supports Archiver archive files in both compressed and uncompressed
mode, and it provides a <em>transparent</em> integration. In fact, archive files
are treated like directories, so when you double-click an archive file, 
TIImageTool will act as if you entered a subdirectory.</p>
<p>Within this kind of "directory" you have all features of TIImageTool at your
control: You can view files, copy, delete, rename files, or even create new archives
within. Indeed - you can step into <em>nested archives</em> at any level. This is a
useful feature which you will enjoy when you encounter archive files that 
contain archives themselves: You need not unpack everything first but simply follow
the path through all nested archives. Unpacking or packing files is simply done 
by opening the archive and doing the usual file operations.</p>

<p>The only operation you are not allowed to do in archives is to create a subdirectory,
as the Archiver format does not implement this feature. However, using nested
archives you can get a similar effect, although it has a noticeably worse performance:
Any change you apply to a nested archive will imply a re-packing of its 
parent and recursively of all its ancestors.</p>

<a name="newarch"></a>
<h4>Create archive</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>This function creates an empty archive. Although TIImageTool can cope with
empty archives, you should not try to open it with the Archiver or other tools 
on the TI or Geneve, as those tools may not have been designed to handle 
empty archives.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Archive file name</em>: As every other file name, this name must be 
<a href="#valid">valid</a>. The proposed file name is FILES_ARK.</li>
<li><em>LZW compression</em>: Set by default; will make archives much smaller, but
it also increases the processing time (not only here but also on the TI). Most
archives are compressed.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Empty archives are like empty directories, and you can carry on
by copying files into the archive.</p>

<h3>Archiving files</h3>
<p>You can archive files in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the files into an already open archive. This may be an empty archive
created by the <a href="#newarch">above</a> procedure or an already filled archive.</li>
<li>Create an archive from a selection of files. This function is available from
the context menu, and you can specify the name and the compression in the same
way as when creating an <a href="#newarch">empty archive</a>. The proposed name
is derived from the name of the first file in the selection.</li>
</ul>
<p>After copying into the archive, the archive file is instantly recreated. If there
is not enough space on the image, an error message is issued, and the archive
file remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Writing a set of files into an archive is a <strong>noticeably</strong> complex process because
the archive is recreated for each single file. This will hopefully be fixed in a later
release. So please be <strong>patient</strong> when you insert twenty or so files into an archive.</p>

<h3>Unpacking archives</h3>
<p>Archives are treated like directories. This means that by double-clicking on
them you enter the archive just like a directory. You can unpack the files in this
archive simply by <em>copying</em> them elsewhere. For instance, to unpack the
archive in the same directory, enter the archive, select all files, choose copy,
enter the parent directory (which is the directory where the archive file is located),
and paste the files.</p>

<a name="viewing"></a>
<h2>Viewing contents</h2>

<p>Each file may have a specific method to view its contents. In the context menu
you can find a choice of applicable ways. The standard way to look at the file
is used when you double-click on the file.</p>

<p>You can also select multiple files. In that case, viewing will be restricted
to the ways that are supported by all files in the set, and all selected files
will be shown in individual frames.</p>

<a name="fibdump"></a>
<h3>View file information block</h3>
<p>This feature is particularly interesting when the file entries seem to
have errors. You can have a look at the FIB as found on the image.</p>

<a name="hexdump"></a>
<h3>View plain dump</h3>
<p>You can inspect each file in its plain dump format as a hex dump, including text files
or BASIC programs. You can use this to find out more about the format of the file
or when other options do not deliver the desired result.</p>

<a name="textview"></a>
<h3>View as text</h3>
<p>All files with DIS/VAR 80 format are assumed to be text files. Double-clicking
on them will open the text viewer. You can then save the text to a file on your
PC file system, or copy it into the clipboard. Editing is not yet possible, although
you can achive this by creating a new file with text content, and copying the 
contents into the editor frame.</p>

<a name="imageview"></a>
<h3>View as image</h3>
<p>TIImageTool recognizes three image formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>TI-ARTIST format: Consists of two PROGRAM files which are dumps of the pattern
table and of the color table in video RAM. Both files are expected to be 6 KiB long each.
If the color table file is missing, a black/white scheme is assumed. If the pattern
table file is missing, a checkerboard pattern is assumed. You can select 
either file to open the image view.</li>
<li>MY-ART format: Single file of DIS/FIX 128 format, run length-encoded. There
are some variants, most notably the YAPP format, which is also detected and
properly displayed.</li>
<li>FRACTALS! format: Single file of DIS/FIX 255 format, used with the FRACTALS!
program, a program written by me ... long time ago when fractals was fab.</li>
</ul>

<h3>View as UTIL/GK dump</h3>
<p>Viewing a <em>UTIL/GK</em> dump is almost the same as viewing the plain dump,
with the exception that the UTIL or GK header is analyzed and the addresses 
are automatically set according to this information. In this version the header 
can only be used for the ROM portions of a GK dump, so this option does not show 
up for the GROM parts.</p>
<p>This option is not available when the program does not recognize the first
bytes of the file as a valid UTIL or GK header.</p>

<a name="list"></a>
<h3>List BASIC program</h3>
<p>When TTImageTool concludes that the selected file is a BASIC program, it 
offers the option to list the BASIC program, and double-clicking will open this
listing as well. BASIC programs are recognized in three formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>PROGRAM files, the standard format for BASIC.</li>
<li>DIS/VAR 163 files, used for MERGE files in Extended Basic. BASIC programs stored
in this format can be merged with the current program in memory.</li>
<li>INT/VAR 254 files, used for long Extended Basic programs that cannot be 
dumped from the memory as a normal PROGRAM file.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, programs are displayed in the style as used by Extended Basic.
In particular, this means that several subsequent colons are displayed with
spaces in between so that they are not interpreted as the statement separator (double colon).
This behaviour can be changed in the <a href="#pref">Preferences</a>.</p>

<a name="escaping"></a>
<h3>Unprintable characters</h3>
<p>In text files, all bytes are supposed to be visible in the viewer frame.
However, there may be unprintable characters, used as control characters for
formatting, or used in BASIC programs for defining graphics. You can tell
TIImageTool to replace these unprintable characters by a single character,
or by an <em>escape sequence</em>. This can be configured in the <a href="#pref">Preferences</a>.</p>
<p>There are essentially two option so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single character replacement: Default is "." (dot); you can choose any other
character on your keyboard.</li>
<li>Escape sequence: A string like "~%" defines that any unprintable characters
shall be replaced by a tilde (~) followed by the 2-digit hexadecimal ASCII code. 
For example, the character of the key combination CTRL-A would be displayed
as ~81. If there is a tilde in the original text, it will be doubled (~~). 
You can choose the escape character, but the second character must be a percent sign (%).</li>
</ul>

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="disassemb"></a>
<h2>Disassembling</h2>

<p>TIImageTool allows to view the source code for two low-level languages. You 
can disassemble GPL programs in memory image format (PROGRAM type) and native
machine language programs (TMS99xx) in memory image format (PROGRAM) or tagged
object code format (DIS/FIX 80).</p>

<p><strong>Disassembling</strong> is the reverse operation of converting 
assembly language programs into an executable format. That means, disassembling
allows you to retrieve the human-readable source code from the executable code.</p>

<p>Not all original information can be restored, however. Unlike BASIC programs,
machine language programs do not store comments. Also, data words, bytes, or texts
cannot easily be distinguished from machine commands. When we encounter a sequence
of bytes in memory, these bytes may have been assembled from a DATA line, but 
possibly also from a command line.</p>

<p>In TIImageTool, you can give the disassembler some <strong>hints</strong> how
the bytes should be disassembled. In particular, you can specify regions in the
code which have to be interpreted as data.</p>

<h3>Disassembling TMS99xx</h3>
<p>Assembler programs that are written for the TMS99xx platform are also called
native code programs. Native code is stored in two variants:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Program image</strong>: This is a plain sequence of bytes as memory
contents. When the file is read, it is placed into memory at a fixed location.
Program image files are usually stored in a headered format. The header defines
the <em>start location</em> in memory as well as the <em>length</em> of the code,
and also whether there are more files to be loaded (chaining).</li>
<li><strong>Tagged object code</strong>: This is the original output of the 
Assembler tool. Tagged object code is much more expressive than program image
code. It defines memory contents plus the location where these contents are 
to be loaded into memory. Tagged object code can be relocated in memory; the 
loader in the TI system is able to recompute memory locations where the code 
is loaded, including all references to memory addresses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although tagged object code seems to be much more comfortable, loading is
much slower. This is the reason why programmers ultimately try to bind the 
object code to a program file.</p>

<p>Depending on your selection, the TIImageTool disassembler presents a specific
dialog for parameters. Program image files need the precise memory location where
they are intended to be loaded. If the file contains a header, the header contents
are filled as defaults into the dialog. Otherwise you have a chance to adjust these
values. You can also start to disassemble the file somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>When you disassemble tagged object code, you cannot specify a loading address,
since the address is usually defined as relocatable.</p>

<p>Disassembling tagged object code yields results that may be 
re-assembled again. Indeed, TIImageTool tries very hard to create <strong>syntactically correct</strong>
source code. Try it with some small examples to get an idea how well the
original source code can be reproduced.</p>

<h3>Disassembling GPL</h3>

<p>Decades before Java showed up on the scene, Texas Instruments invented a virtual
machine inside the TI console. This virtual machine has an own machine language
called GPL - Graphics Programming Language. GPL is a complex instruction set
8-bit language. It is specifically tailored for use inside the TI computer,
introducing more addressing modes with all available memory 
spaces (CPU, VDP, GROM, CRU) for source and target addressing. The TI BASIC interpreter is completely
written in GPL. And now you know why it is so slow.</p>

<p>TIImageTool contains a GPL disassembler. GPL code is only available in memory
image format, and it cannot be loaded in the TI system, as GPL is only intended
for use in GROMs, which can be found in the console or in cartridges. But even when
you do not intend to write own GPL programs, you may be interested in finding out
how some cartridges are programmed.</p>

<p>When you work with MAME you can try to have a look at the GROM contents of
the console: Unpack the ti99_4x.zip file, and import the file with the GROM 
contents into a disk image. Once it is on the disk image you can start the
disassembler to get the source code.</p>

<p>There are <strong>different variants</strong> of the GPL source code format,
which is due to the fact that TI did not release a specification to the public. 
Compared to the code as seen in the popular <em>TI Intern</em> book, there are 
some differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source/destination order: TIImageTool uses the same operand ordering as the
native machine language: <em>DST @>8346,@>8344</em> is an instruction that 
copies the two bytes from address 8346 to address 8344.</li>
<li>FMT: The formatting sublanguage has been reformulated to make it better readable.</li>
<li>BTEXT: A special TEXT directive has been introduced to represent biased 
character strings which are used in BASIC.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disassembler hints</h3>

<p>As already mentioned the disassembler cannot know whether the bytes it 
finds in the file were created from instructions or from data or text lines. 
You can give the disassembler some hints how to interpret the data appropriately.
Several hints can be written one after another, separated by spaces, commas,
or newlines.</p>

<p>The good thing: The disassembler hints are <strong>stored</strong>
in the settings file.  Actually, TIImageTool uses the <strong>contents of 
the file to compute a key</strong> to look up the values, so you can rename the file on 
the image, and the values are still correctly found.</p>

<p>The hints make use of memory location specifications. We make use of the 
term <em>location</em> as a generalized form of an <em>address</em>

<ul>
<li><em>Absolute address</em>: specifies the actual memory address. Examples: 837C, 0x837c, >837C, X837C,
all of which are equivalent.</li>
<li><em>Program-relocatable address</em>: specifies the offset from the loading address. The relocatable 
address is specified as Rxxxx, with xxxx being the offset. Example: R0123.</li>
<li><em>Common-relocatable</em> and <em>data-relocatable address</em>: Special memory scopes that
are not supported by the loader of the Editor/Assembler cartridge but that are
defined in the Assembler. Common-relocatable addresses look like Sbxxxx, with
b being the segment number, xxxx being the offset in the segment; data-relocatable
addresses are specified as Txxxx, like T0123.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>There are several kinds of hints:</p>

<p><strong>Data region</strong></p>
<p>Format: <em>data(from,to)</em></p>
<p>Tells the disassembler to create DATA lines for the given memory region. In the 
memory image formats of the native language or GPL language, the addresses are 
specified as 4-digit hexadecimal (absolute) addresses. For tagged image code,
addresses are specified as locations.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: data(R0100,R017F) - declares the region of
relocatable addresses 0100 to 017F as a data area.</p>

<p><strong>Text region</strong></p>

<p>Format: <em>text(from,to)</em></p>
<p>Tells the disassembler to create TEXT lines for the given memory region. If
the bytes are not within the range of displayable characters, BYTE lines are
created instead.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: text(X6100,X6277) - declares the region of
absolute addresses 6100 to 6277 as a text area.</p>
<p>Format: <em>btext(from,to)</em></p>
<p><em>Only available for GPL</em>. Similar to <em>text(,)</em>, but the characters
in the region are shifted by 96 positions. This is the case in TI BASIC. Using
this hint, the disassembler can create useful (readable) representations of the
region.</p>

<p><strong>Referenced line</strong></p>

<p>Format: <em>ref(location)</em></p>
<p><em>Only available for tagged object code</em>. The contents at the specified
location are referenced by another line, for instance, as a jump or branch
target or by source or target memory access. This means that the contents are very
likely not suitable as arguments of another command. With this feature you can
prevent the disassembler to falsely consume the bytes at this location when it
tries to disassemble an assumed command in the predecessing location.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: ref(R0204) - the word at the relocatable location
0204 is referenced from somewhere else.</p>

<p><strong>Call parameters</strong></p>

<p>Format: <em>param(branchTarget,count)</em></p>
<p>Specifies that a BL / BLWP call (in GPL a CALL operation) is followed by
a fixed number of data parameters. In the native machine language, you can only
specify a number of 16-bit data words. In GPL, the count refers to the number of
8-bit bytes.</p>
<p>You can specify the <em>branchTarget</em> by the location of the subprogram,
or by its label. Labels must be enclosed in quotes.</p>
<p>The number of following data lines must be constant for each branch target,
as the disassembler cannot find out how many data lines are required at run time. 
If you are serious, you don't really want to write your programs this way.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: param("XMLLNK",1) defines that calls to XMLLNK are
always followed by one DATA line.</p>

<p><strong>FMT inhibit</strong></p>

<p>Format: <em>nofmt(from,to)</em></p>
<p><em>Only available for GPL</em>. Prevents the disassembler to disassemble FMT
commands in the specified area. This is useful in order to prevent a false 
disassembly of data items as FMT. The specific problem with FMT is that it can
be used to build nested formatting structures, and in that role, each FMT must be 
terminated by a matching END directive. If the disassembler runs into plain
data areas, this constraint is not fulfilled, and the rest of the area will end up 
in a phantom FMT block. An error message will be printed at the end which informs
about the location of the unmatched FMT command.</p>

<a name="dis"></a>
<h4>Disassembler parameters (TMS99xx memory image)</h4>
<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>Head of file</em>: The first 16 bytes are shown so that you can decide
whether this file has a <em>header</em>.</li>
<li><em>Type</em>: Memory dump</li>
<li><em>Symbolic disassembly</em>: You can tell the disassembler to try to
produce code that can be assembled again. This is actually a feature of the tagged
object code disassembler which has been made available for the memory dumps.</li>
<li><em>File offset</em>: If the file has a header this offset specifies where the
actual contents begin. This is usually at byte 6 if there is a header.</li>
<li><em>Start address</em>: The disassembler attempts to interpret the first
bytes as a header; if there is a header actually, this would be the address
where the program is loaded.</li>
<li><em>Length</em>: Accordingly, the length is retrieved from the header.</li>
<li><em>Show raw data at line end</em>: Adds the bytes to the line end which were used
for disassembly.</li>
<li><em>Show locations at line end</em>: Shows the locations of the lines. This is
useful for symbolic disassembly; for memory dump disassembly you will see the line numbers
at the start of each line..</li>
<li><em>Disassembler hints</em>: Specify the disassembler hints as described above.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>Disassembler parameters (TMS99xx tagged object code)</h4>
<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>Head of file</em>: The first 16 bytes are shown so that you can decide
whether this file has a <em>header</em>.</li>
<li><em>Type</em>: Tagged object code</li>
<li><em>Show locations at line end</em>: Shows the locations of the lines. By default, line
locations are shown only when referenced.</li>
<li><em>Show raw data at line end</em>: Adds the bytes to the line end which were used
for disassembly.</li>
<li><em>Disassembler hints</em>: Specify the disassembler hints as described above.</li>

<h4>Disassembler parameters (GPL)</h4>
<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>Head of file</em>: The first 16 bytes are shown so that you can decide
whether this file has a <em>header</em>.</li>
<li><em>Type</em>: Memory dump</li>
<li><em>File offset</em>: Start location in the file. The byte at this offset
will be assigned the address in the next line.</li>
<li><em>Start address</em>: GPL files do not have a header. You must specify
where the data are located.</li>
<li><em>Length</em>: How many bytes shall be used for disassembly</li>
<li><em>Skip invalid GROM addresses</em>: Original GROMs only have 6 KiB contents; 
the disassembler will skip the last 2 KiB of each 8 KiB block.</li>
<li><em>Show raw data at line end</em>: Adds the bytes to the line end which were used
for disassembly.</li>
<li><em>Disassembler hints</em>: Specify the disassembler hints as described above.</li>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>These are the hints to be used for disassembling GROM 0 and the first 512 bytes
of GROM 1. Use 0000 for <em>offset</em> and <em>start address</em>, and 2200 for <em>length</em>.</p>

<h3>Archive files</h3>
<p>As long as they are not open, archive files are treated just like files - you
can view their contents as a plain dump. However, you can open them by double-clicking
or by selecting <em>Enter</em> in the context menu, and just as with a directory,
the current tab displays the contents of the archive. Watch the path information
in the heading showing an "(Archive)" notice.</p>
<p>You can create an empty archive and copy files into that archive as you do
with a directory, or you can create an archive from selected files. The archive
name is suggested by taking the first 6 characters from the first file name and 
adding "_ARK". You can change this suggestion if there are already files in the
directory with that name.</p>
<p>Find more about this feature in the <a href="#archiving">Archive support</a>
section.</p>

<h3>Directories</h3>
<p>Viewing a directory is simply done by double-clicking on its name, or by 
selecting <em>Enter</em> in the context menu. Note that directories are
always listed at the beginning of the contents, and that they are shown in
blue colored text, like the archive files. To close the view, you can either
completely close the tab, or you enter the parent directory "..". The root directory
has no parent.

<a name="expimp"></a>
<h2>Exporting and importing</h2>

<p>Sometimes you may want to send a file to someone else by E-mail, or you 
are using an emulation that makes use of external files (like Classic99). In this
situation you have to <strong>export</strong> a file from a disk image to
the host file system.</p>

<p>Exporting and importing are simple ways to exchange files with a real 
TI system via a serial connection. The standard 
external format TIFILES was defined long ago just with the requirements of uploading and 
downloading TI files to or from a file server.</p>

<a name="importf"></a>
<h3>Importing a TIFILES file</h3>
<p>TIFILES files are files on a non-TI file system (e.g. on a PC) which contain
information about the contents and about the file format which would otherwise 
be lost in a PC file system. Essentially, the file from the TI is put inside this 
format with the relevant entries from its <em>File Information Block</em> and
with the contents of the sectors it occupied.</p>
<p>TIImageTool will analyze the information at the head of the file and rebuild
the file within the currently open directory. That is, you can import the file
at any location in the image.</p>
<p>The file name is specified in the head of the file as well, but earlier versions
of the TIFILES format did not require a file name in the header, so it will
not be found during import. In this case, TIImageTool offers two possibilities: </p>
<ul>
<li>You specify the name in a dialog window.</li>
<li>You let the importer guess a suitable name.</li>
</ul>

<a name="impparam"></a>
<h4>Import Parameters</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>You get this dialog window only when the file to be imported lacks a file name
in the TIFILES header</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Use this file name</em>: The field shows a suggestion for a <a href="#valid">valid</a> file name.
You can accept this or choose another one.</li>
<li><em>Guess each file name</em>: If selected, the importer will not ask again
but use its own suggestions for importing files that do not define a file
name in the TIFILES header.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Guessing the name is particularly useful when you want to import a larger
set of files and you really do not want to define every single name. The importer
takes the PC file name and creates a valid TI file system name by stripping off
the <em>suffix</em> (".tfi", ".tifile", ".tifiles") if there is one, converting
all letters to <em>uppercase</em>, replacing <em>"."</em> by an underscore, and
truncating the name to 10 characters. This turns "telco.ark.tfi" into "TELCO_ARK".</p>

<p>You can find the rules by which the name conversion takes place in the 
<a href="#pref">Preferences</a> dialog.</p>

<p>You can also import files which do not have a TIFILES header. These files 
may have been created by some communication tools that spared this header to lower
the communication overhead. In that case you will get a dialog window where you
can specify all missing data, from file name to file type, record length, and more.
The dialog window fields are initially filled with a suggested DIS/FIX 128 format.
</p>
<p>It is recommended to use the ".tfi" suffix so that the file dialog can
filter away all other files in the directory. If the file has another suffix
you must switch to "all files" in the file filter.</p>

<p>You get the following dialog window when the file has a TIFILES header, but the name
is not valid. This is a somewhat exceptional situation, so the auto-repeat is
not offered here.</p>

<h4>Import Parameters</h4>
<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>Use this file name</em>: The field shows a suggestion for a <a href="#valid">valid</a> file name.
You can accept this or choose another one.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In this release, you can define your own preferences for handling file names
during import and export. For instance, you can specify that the file name of the
file on the PC file system shall be used as a file name within the TI file system,
or, shortly, to <strong>ignore the file name</strong> in the TIFILES header. When there is no
suitable file name you can tell the program to use the external file name so 
it will not ask you to provide a name. The external file name will, however, 
be checked for characters that are not allowed in the TI file system, and they will be replaced
appropriately.</p>

<a name="importt"></a>
<h3>Importing text or BASIC files</h3>
<p>If the file on the PC file system is a plain text file, you can import that
file as a DIS/VAR 80 file. This also means that the PC-typical file structure
with lines, separated by CRLF or LF, has to be converted to a sequence of
variable records with length byte. This is automatically done in this function.</p>

<p>TIImageTool tries to figure out whether the file is a text file or not, and
offers you a dialog window where you can ultimately decide. If it detects
other non-printable characters, it will present you the dialog as mentioned above
(for files without TIFILES header). Sometimes, text files also contain control
characters like ASCII 12 (form feed); instead of catching each of these exceptions,
the programs leaves the decision up to you.</p>

<h4>Import Parameters</h4>
<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>File name</em>: The field shows a suggestion for a <a href="#valid">valid</a> file name.
You can accept this or choose another one.</li>
<li><em>DIS/VAR 80 text file</em>: If the file contents shown at the bottom 
indicate this is a text file, you should select this option.</li>
<li><em>Other format</em>: In other cases you can set the format here. Note that
DIS/VAR 80 in this part lacks the transformation of text lines.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Also new to this release, TIImageTool will try to find out whether the 
imported file is a BASIC program. For this purpose it looks at the first ten lines (or less)
and tries to parse them for TI BASIC and then for Extended Basic. When successful,
it offers you a modified import dialog.<p>

<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>File name</em>: The field shows a suggestion for a <a href="#valid">valid</a> file name.
You can accept this or choose another one.</li>
<li><em>DIS/VAR 80 text file</em>: Maybe you still want to store the file 
in text format.</li>
<li><em>TI BASIC</em>: Create a TI BASIC program file.</li>
<li><em>Extended Basic</em>: When you click this option you will get some more
options to select:</li>
<li><em>Save file in</em>: Determine the save format. You can save 
as program file, as a mergeable file, or as a long file. If the file is too 
long to be saved in program format, this dialog will reappear for you to choose
another option.</li>
<li><em>LIST protection</em>: You can save the program with LIST protection;
when you load it and try to LIST it, Extended Basic will output an error message.
This protection is not visible in the file system.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Importing directories</h3>
<p>This is actually a counterpart of the <a href="#export">export</a> feature explained
below. You can recreate the whole directory structure (if possible; mind that 
floppy disks only allow a single layer of directories). The information about
the directory name is stored in a file called <em>meta.inf</em>.
</p>

<h3>Importing from text editor</h3>
<p>This feature is mainly useful when you want to add a new text file into your
disk image. Suppose you want to program some application in assembly language,
but you prefer to use your editor on the PC. In that case you can simply paste 
the text contents from the clipboard into the open window and save it.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also use the file import function.</p>

<p>Here as well, TIImageTool tries to figure out whether this can be 
interpreted as a BASIC file, and if that is the case, it will provide you 
with the options listed above.</p>

<h4>Import content parameters</h4>
<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>File name</em>: Specify a <a href="#valid">valid</a> name of the new file on the image.</li>
<li><em>File format</em>: The only choice at this time is DIS/VAR 80.</li>
<li><em>Replace TABs</em>: If there are TAB characters in the new file you
can tell the program to leave them unchanged, or to replace them by a number of spaces.</li>
<li><em>Special characters</em>: These are the characters outside of the standard
set of printable ASCII characters (32-127).</li>
<li><em>Translations</em>: Comma-separated list of characters that shall replace
the corresponding special character.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The TAB and special characters entry is only shown if such characters were 
found. For instance, the umlaut characters are usually mapped 
to {, |, and } in the German versions of TI Writer.</p>

<h3>Importing binary files</h3>
<p>Usually you should always have a proper TIFILES header when importing. However,
you may probably want to import a plain binary file (for instance, a dump from 
a cartridge).</p>

<h4>Import parameters</h4>
<div class="program">
See <a href="#impparam">above</a>. 
</div>

<a name="importr"></a>
<h3>Importing from remote</h3>
<p>You can try to read your TI floppy disks with the PC floppy drive (this is
perfectly possible, since TI used standard formats, but you must have access
to the low-level functions of the controller to configure the parameters), connect
your SCSI drive to a SCSI adapter, or you transfer the files via a serial connection.
</p>
<p>Using this menu item you can utilize the <em>XModem</em> support in TIImageTool,
and by this way you can send files from the TI where you have to run a suitable
terminal program like TELCO or PORT.</p>
<p>See more on that in the section on <a href="#serial">serial connections</a>.</p>

<hr>

<a name="export"></a>
<h3>Export image</h3>
<p>The export function is closely related to the <a href="#save">Save as TIFILE</a>
option in the context menu. Unlike that one, however, it acts as if the root
directory of the currently selected image has been selected.</p>
<p>The <a href="#footnotes">TIFILES</a> format has been established as an 
external format for files stored in TI file system. This external format 
preserves all file meta-information beside the file contents. TIFILES files
may be easily imported into TI disk images. Also, terminal emulator programs
like <em>TELCO</em> or <em>PORT</em> make use of the TIFILES format when sending
or receiving TI files. Sometimes the TIFILES format is also called the <em>XModem</em>
format as the data transmitted by XModem is stored in this format on the remote 
computer side. The format itself has nothing to do with the actual XModem protocol.</p>

<p>The complete image will be exported, including all subdirectories. 
The volume of the currently open and selected directory is exported to a directory
on the PC file system that you select in the file chooser.</p>

<a name="expparam"></a>
<h4>Export parameters</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>The export feature suggests a scheme for creating file names for the TIFILES
files.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>File name suffix</em>: The suggested suffix is <em>tfi</em>.</li>
<li><em>Convert to lowercase</em>: File names on the TI images are normally set as uppercase; on the PC, most
file names are lowercase. This option automatically converts the names to lowercase.</li>
<li><em>Character replacement</em>: File names on the TI may contain characters 
which are not allowed in PC file systems, like "/" or "\". You can determine
which name is to be used for the file on the PC. The actual file name is stored inside the TIFILES
file so that on import, the original file name will be restored.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>For each directory on the TI image a directories is created in the target folder.
To preserve the original name,
a file called <strong>meta.inf</strong> is put into each directory, containing
meta-information about this directory. At this time, the inf file only contains
the actual directory name.</p>

<p>As a result you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every file on the image is stored as a TIFILES file</li>
<li>Every directory on the image corresponds to a directory on the target drive</li>
<li>All files and directories are located in their respective containing directories.</li>
</ul>

<a name="save"></a>
<h3>Save as TIFILES file</h3>
<p>You can save a single file or a set of marked files to your PC's file
system in TIFILES format. All information is stored inside the file header so that
you will be able to import these files comfortably, without specifying anything but
the target directory.</p>
<p>If the file you want to export is a text file, you should better open a 
<a href="#textview">text view</a> and save it from there.</p>

<p>The only thing that you have to specify here is what PC file name shall be used.
If you create a single file you have to provide the name directly. For a set of files,
you will be supported by a file name creator which guesses suitable names.</p>

<h4>Export parameters</h4>
<div class="program">
See <a href="#expparam">above.</a>
</div>

<p>The <a href="#export">Export image</a> feature is similar, but it always exports the
whole image. This also includes all contained directories. As 
a result you will find a directory structure on your PC drive with the respective
exported files in it, and each directory contains a special file which tells the
importer what name to assign to the newly created directory.</p>

<h3>Save as plain dump</h3>
<p>This option saves the contents of the file as a raw dump. With a hex editor
you can see the same contents as if you were <a href="#hexdump">viewing</a> 
the file as a plain dump.</p>

<a name="sendrem"></a>
<h3>Send to remote</h3>
<p>This is the counterpart to the remote import from above. You can transmit 
a file to a remote system, usually another TI or Geneve running a suitable
application, using XModem. In this version you can only send a single file, not
a list of files.</p>

<hr>

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<a name="serial"></a>
<h2>Serial connections</h2>

<p>For all serial operations in TIImageTool you need the <strong>RXTX library</strong> which 
provides an access to the system's serial adaptors. If TIImageTool does not find 
the RXTX library it will disable all these features.</p>

<p>For some more information on setting up RXTX and on working with the
serial connection please see <strong>www.ninerpedia.org</strong>.</p>

<p>TIImageTool utilizes the serial connection for two purposes.</p>

<h3>File transfer via XModem</h3>
<p>XModem transfer is a traditional way of transmitting files over a serial connection,
between directly connected computers or using a modem connection.</p>
<p>You have to start suitable applications at both ends of the connection; one
side is the sender, the other the receiver. Using <strong>Send to remote</strong>
you configure TIImageTool to be the sender. You can choose TELCO, PORT, MYTERM
or other tools on the TI/Geneve side to provide the receiver. The same programs
will also serve as sender.</p>

<h4>Serial connection setup</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>For setting up the connection you have to specify some parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Serial adapter</em>: This is your serial device at the PC side. In Linux 
you will use a device like <tt>/dev/ttyS0</tt> while on Windows, serial adapters
sound like <tt>COM1:</tt>. The available adapters are listed in a selection.</li>
<li><em>Speed</em>: You can select a speed between 110 and 19200 baud. Using 9600
baud proved to be sufficiently reliable on both sides.</li>
<li><em>Data bits, stop bits, parity</em>: Common choices are 8 data bits, 1 stop bit,
no parity. You should stay with these values.</li>
<li><em>Transfer protocol (upload)</em>: XModem has some variations that you can choose; beside 
the standard variant there is the XModem-1K option which uses larger data blocks. This
speeds up the transfer but is not recommended for unstable connections. The
opposite side must support the variant, otherwise the sender gets back to the 
standard option as default.</li>
<li><em>Transfer protocol (download)</em>: You can select the standard variant or the XModem/CRC
option which requests the sender to provide CRC values. The XModem-1K option always implies CRC.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The receiver must define the same parameters. One exception is the transfer 
protocol option which is negotiated between both sides. During the transfer you can watch the progress of the file transfer. When receiving,
TIImageTool will place the file into the currently open directory.</p>

<a name="serialbr"></a>
<h3>Serial bridge</h3>

<p>The <em>serial bridge</em> is a special feature used in conjunction with 
the serial emulation in MAME. It is used to establish a serial connection 
with another computer, in particular with a real TI or Geneve. The serial bridge
consists of a server socket which communicates with MAME, and the serial library
using RXTX which operates a local serial interface. </p>

<h4>Serial bridge setup</h4>
<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>Serial adapter</em>: Specify the serial port (something like /dev/ttyS0 in Linux or COM1 in Windows). 
The selection lists all currently available interfaces.</li>
<li><em>Port</em>: Port on which the process listens for data coming from MAME.
You must specify the same port when starting MAME.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>If you get an error message <em>"No serial ports found"</em> then either you
actually do not have a serial port, or all serial ports are already used.</p>

<p>Assuming that the bridge uses port 10000 on the same computer where MAME
is running, you have to specify this as follows:</p>
<pre>
   mess ti99_4a -peb:slot6 tirs232 -serl1 socket.localhost:10000
</pre>

<p>You can also launch the serial bridge without bringing up the TIImageTool GUI by starting
it with the parameter BRIDGE:</p>

<pre>
java -jar tiimagetool.jar BRIDGE /dev/ttyS0 10000
</pre>

<p>Other than in the XModem scenario, you <em>cannot set parameters</em> of the serial 
bridge. These are actually set by the connected MAME emulator, or, more precisely,
by the application running inside the emulator.</p>

<p>With this bridge running, you can let the emulated TI/Geneve communicate
with a real TI/Geneve or you can attach a modem. Concerning the XModem communication,
you can now run TELCO on both sides (emulated and real) and use it to move
files between them.</p>

<p>The serial bridge menu item is always available, unless you have already 
opened it; you can only run a single bridge with TIImageTool. Please 
make sure you have prepared everything for the creation of the serial connection;
check with the manuals of RXTX. In particular, you must be eligible to access
the serial interface of your PC, and you must have permission to create a 
lock file in /var/lock (when using Linux).</p>

<a name="utilmenu"></a>
<a name="utilities"></a>
<h2>Utilities</h2>
<p>Many of the features have been explained above; here are the remaining 
points.</p>

<a name="redir"></a>
<h3>View Console output</h3>
<p>When you select this function, the log file is opened and shown in a new
window. Note that each start of TIImageTool adds a separator line (=====) but
does not clear the log file. You can clear the file by the menu selection
<strong>Clear content</strong> in the <strong>File</strong> menu of the
log output window.
</p>
<p>The window shows the contents of the log file at the point of opening 
and is updated when new entries are added. If you prefer to see the output
in the console from where you launched TIImageTool, you must remove the file 
name in the Preferences, thus 
redirecting the output back to the standard output and error channels. Of course,
you do not see any output when you start TIImageTool by double-clicking its
symbol on the desktop; in this case you should enter a log file name.
</p>

<a name="check"></a>
<h3>Checking the filesystem</h3>
<p>Using this function we can check the integrity of the file system. 
This is a multi-stage test which checks the following properties:</p> 

<ul>
<li>For each file, all referenced allocation units are actually marked as
allocated in the allocation map. If it finds an unallocated location on the
image, it will ask the user whether to allocate this unit to the file. However,
we cannot be sure that the resulting file is correct. In the meantime, the missing
allocation unit may have been allocated to another file and released again.</li>
<li>For each allocation unit that is marked as used there must be a file
that it is allocated to. If not, this indicates that the allocation map has not
been updated properly. These over-allocations can usually be released safely.</li>
<li>For each allocated unit there is exactly one file it belongs to. If two files
share the same allocation units this cannot automatically be repaired. You should
then copy both files and check which one is still intact, then remove both files.</li>
<li>Files should not contain sectors that are filled with certain bytes which
are used to indicate freshly formatted sectors.</li>
<li>Some files have an incorrect L3 value. This value contains the number of
records in a fixed format file, but it must be set as little-endian (the only
instance in the whole TI-99 world). Obviously some third-party DSR or utility
program did not consider this. This check detects these L3 errors and allows
you to have them fixed.</li>
<li>TDF images (PC99) usually have a "pseudo CRC" field filled with F7F7, but
they can also carry a true value, which is then checked in MAME. 
Former releases of TIImageTool had a bug that created bad CRC values; this
can be fixed by this Filesystem check. Only TDF images are checked. You can
choose whether to fix the value, or whether to deactivate it by resetting to 
F7F7.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the "broken sectors" check, formatting procedures usually fill all sectors with
values like E5E5 or D7A5. Some copying tools fill sectors with the value DEAD if 
the sector was not successfully copies. Although it may happen that such values
indeed appear purposefully within the file, in most cases this is an indication that
something is wrong. You should then check by yourself what might be the problem
with this file.</p>

<h3>Install Geneve OS</h3>
<a name="genos"></a>
<p>One of the problems you first encounter when you start up a Geneve (whether
real or emulated) is that you will get an error message if no disk is inserted in 
drive one, containing the operating system.</p>
<p>TIImageTool contains in its JAR file a freely distributable release of the operating 
system called <em>Geneve Operating System</em> (formerly called <em>MDOS</em>).
The main operating system file is called <strong>SYSTEM/SYS</strong>; another
file is required when the HFDC controller is used, called <strong>LOAD/SYS</strong>.
Finally, similar to known operating systems on the PC, a text file named <strong>AUTOEXEC</strong>
contains commands that are executed after booting is complete.</p>
<p>For bootable floppy disks, all three files are put into the root directory of
the floppy disk that is currently selected.</p>
<p>For bootable hard disks, the LOAD/SYS file is put into a directory that is 
located at root level; the other two files are put into the root directory.</p>
<p>Unless there was an error (maybe because the disk was already full), you can
directly boot the Geneve with this disk mounted as floppy disk 1, or with a hard disk as
hard disk 1.</p>

<a name="search"></a>
<h3>Search for files and content</h3>
<p>Have you ever desperately looked for a file? No idea what disk it was 
stored on? - The search function in TIImageTool provides you with a flexible
tool to find your files.</p>
<p>Besides looking for file names, you can even search for content. For this
search process, a copy of the file contents is searched, where all non-printable
characters have been replaced by space characters. The original file is not affected. 
Searching for content takes more time, but it may be the only way if you
don't even remember the file name.</p>
<p>During the search process, a progress window pops up that allows you to
interrupt the process. It also informs you what image file is currently
checked, and how many hits have been found at this time.</p>
<p>Finally, a result window is displayed. When you click on a result, the
image containing the match will be opened in the main window. The file
may be contained in a subdirectory; you will have to navigate there manually.</p>

<h4>Search parameters</h4>
<div class="program">
<ul>
<li><em>Search text</em>: File name (or just a part) that you are looking for.
For plain text searches, the matcher lists all files that contain this text.
If the text is "EDI", file names like "EDIT1" or "SEDICI" will match.</li>
<li><em>Regular expression</em>: When set, the search text is interpreted as
a regular expression. If the search text is "ED.T", the dot represents any
character, so files like "EDIT" or "EDUT" match, but not "EDIT1". See the 
Java documentation (java.util.regex) for more examples.</li>
<li><em>Search file names or content</em>: Look for a match in file names only
or within file contents. In both cases you can opt for plain search or regular
expression search.</li>
<li><em>Include archive files</em>: Files that were packed with ARCHIVER can
be searched, too - even nested archives. In this case, archive files are treated 
as directories.</li>
<li><em>Path to search</em>: Select folders or image files, or both, in any number.
If you do not specify a search path, the search process is canceled.</li>
<li><em>Limit extensions to</em>: When left blank, no restrictions apply, and all
files are checked that are found in the path. Otherwise, only those files are
checked that have a name that ends by one of the text strings, separated by commas.
To search disk images only, use ".dsk,.dtk,.hfe".</li>
<li><em>Include subdirectories</em>: When set, the search path will be recursively searched.
Note that this may take quite long, depending on the size of your image collection.
This setting only refers to your PC file system; directories inside the image
files are always searched.</li>
<li><em>Maximum hits</em>: Limits the number of search results.</li>
</ul>

<a name="secedit"></a>
<h3>Sector editing</h3>

<p>If your disk images are created and updated correctly, everything you 
possibly want to do is already covered by the previous functions. But what if
your image is broken? A similar situation occurs when you discover that there is a flaw in the
file information block of a file, and you know you just have to change a few
values to make it work again.</p>
<p>As a <em>1337 h4xx0r</em> (leetspeak for "elite hacker", go look it up, I
won't explain everything) you certainly know what to do. You use your
favorite hex editor and change those bad values. On the TI there are some
good programs for that, and on the PC you could, for example, use <strong>ghex</strong>.</p>

<p>This will work, but only for the simple cases of DSK images. The reason
is that not all images contain the sector contents in a simple, direct way.
Remember that the DSK files (sector dump) are just a concatenation of
sector contents from the first to the last sector. The DTK format (track dumps)
are a bit trickier: You have to locate the sector first, then change the
value, then remember to fix the CRC value of the sector, or you will get 
CRC errors. And for the HFE format, none of that will work, because this 
format just contains MFM level changes. Good luck with finding out the MFM 
encoding of your changes...</p>

<p>Accordingly, the sector editor of TIImageTool works <strong>on top of</strong>
the image format; this means you can actually edit the sector bytes, but the format
implementation will take care of writing the appropriate changes to the image.
</p>

<p><strong>You cannot edit the sectors of an open image.</strong> No, you 
wouldn't like it, really. Just close it before you try to edit it, which means
all tabs for that image.</p>

<ul>
<li>Select the image file to be sector-edited.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the image has been successfully opened, the contents of the first sector
(sector 0) are displayed. On the left side there is the hex byte representation,
while on the right side you should see an ASCII byte display. Only characters
are shown that are printable; all others are shown as periods. That means,
generally you will see a lot of periods on the right side.</p>

<p>There are four input widgets at the top:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sector: Enter the sector number and press Return; this will load and 
display the desired sector. When you add the prefix "0x", the sector number
will be interpreted as a hex number. </li>
<li>First: Pressing this button lets the editor jump back to sector 0.</li>
<li>Previous: This button lets the editor move one sector back until it 
reaches sector 0.</li>
<li>Next: Advance one sector. When the last sector is reached, do not move.</li>
<li>Last: Jump to the end of the image.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you click into the hex or ASCII display, a yellow cursor will appear.
You can now change the values of one byte or of several successive bytes.
Watch how the other display is immediately updated when you change values. 
Pressing Return in the editor windows lets you advance to the next byte.
Pressing ESC leaves the editing mode, and the cursor disappears.</p>

<p>Changes are <strong>not committed</strong> to the image file until you
select <em>Save changes to image</em>. If you close the window before saving, you
are warned that there are unsaved changes. If you feel like having done something
stupid, you can always revert the original contents of the sector, but only
when the edits have not been saved yet. You find this feature in the menu as well.</p>

<p>Finally, you can save the sector contents to a file as a textual hexdump.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<a name="command"></a>
<a name="dirview"></a>
<a name="fileview"></a>
<h3>Command line</h3>
<p>This may be particularly interesting for Linux people. You can start
TIImageTool without windows - just on the command line, or within a script file.</p>

<p>When launching TIImageTool you simply add the parameter <em>CommandShell</em>
and the respective command.</p>

At this time, there are three features you can invoke this way:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Help (-h)</em>: When you add "-h" behind CommandShell, you will get
a short summary of the commands.</li>
<li><em>View directory (dir/ls/lsf)</em>: Creates a directory listing. With
<em>dir</em>, the full information is printed in a formatted way, similarly to the directory
listing within the program. In contrast, <em>ls</em> just outputs the bare 
file names. Usually, this kind of output can be used inside scripts
for some nice further processing. <em>lsf</em> is similar to <em>ls</em> but
adds <em>decorations</em> to the file names: ".d" for directories, ".t" for
DIS/VAR 80 files. Again, you can use that for further processing.</li>
<li><em>View file content (type)</em>: Outputs the contents of text files. You
have to provide the file name after the image name. The file name may contain
a path specification.</li>
<li><em>List BASIC file (list)</em>: Outputs the contents of a BASIC program.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>java -jar tiimagetool.jar CommandLine dir myimage.dsk</li>
<li>java -jar tiimagetool.jar CommandLine ls another.dsk</li>
<li>java -jar tiimagetool.jar CommandLine type myimage.dsk README</li>
<li>java -jar tiimagetool.jar CommandLine type harddrive.chd ASM.SOURCE.PRG_S</li>

<h3>Manual</h3>
<p>This is the manual that you're reading at the moment. You can get it
quickly by pressing F1.</p>

<a name="hints"></a>
<h3>Hints</h3>
<p>You may have noticed that TIImageTool is getting more and more bloated,
and it already takes quite a long time to read through this manual. For this 
reason I added a feature that I paradoxically never liked in other programs.</p>

<p>On startup, a short message will be shown that presents some of the important
capabilities and properties of TIImageTool to you. The good thing is that you
can stop that by selecting <em>Don't show me hints on startup</em>.</p>

<p>Well, you should not do that too quickly. These messages do have some sense,
and while I know well what is inside my program, you very likely do not. Just
let me have a short word on that, and then you can continue. If you know my
hint, you can block it from further bothering you by selecting <em>I know
that one already</em>.</p>

<p>You can use the preferences in the File menu (also see below) to turn on
or off the automatic hints on program start. If you feel like getting a hint
during runtime, just select the menu point in the <em>Help</em> menu, or press
the F3 key.</p>

<h3>About TIImageTool</h3>
<p>This function opens a small message window which tells you the release
number of this program. This is important when you experience problems and 
you want to get some help from other people.</p>

<a name="pref"></a>
<h3>Setting program parameters</h3>
<p>Some settings may be done in this function. The settings are saved to disk
so that they will be available on the next program start. At this time you
can choose the font of the content display.</p> 

<h4>Preferences</h4>
<div class="program">
<p>You can set properties which are saved to disk and loaded the next time you
start TIImageTool.
<ul>
<li><em>Look and feel</em>: Setting for the look-and-feel of the Swing components. The default
is the <em>Metal Look-and-Feel</em>.</li>
<li><em>Show hints on startup</em>: When set, hints will be shown on each program start.
If you change your mind, you can modify this setting any time.</li>
<li><em>Open image in own frame</em>: When set, newly opened image files will
be shown in a "detached" window instead of in a tabbed pane of the main window.</li>
<li><em>Log console output to file</em>: File name of the log file in which error 
outputs are stored. You can set a relative path (which depends on the folder in which 
you start TIImageTool), or an absolute path. When this field is empty, the output
is directed to the standard output and error channel.</li>
<li><em>Temporary directory</em>: In order to support the Drag-and-Drop export functionality,
TIImageTool must first export the files into the file system and then move/copy them. 
A folder will be created inside this path; this folder will them be cleaned on 
program end.</li>
<li><em>Font for program code</em>: You can choose the font to be used for content display.
This should be a monospaced font like Courier.</li>
<li><em>Replace unprintable characters by</em>: a single character will be used to replace each unprintable character; a
character with a following percent produces an escape sequence.</li>
<li><em>LIST by Extended Basic style</em>: The BASIC file listing is compatible with
Extended Basic. This particularly refers to the output of a sequence of colons (:).</li>
<li><em>Force uppercase names</em>: When importing, file names will be uppercased if needed.</li>
<li><em>Ignore name in TIFILES header</em>: Always create the TI file name from the external file name.</li>
<li><em>Suggest TIFILES file filter</em>: When importing, apply a filter to the directory view so that
only files with the .tfi or .tifiles extension are shown.</li>
<li><em>Convert file name to lowercase</em>: On export, create lowercase file names for the external file system.</li>
<li><em>Char conversion rules</em>: Two strings separated by a blank. The first string enumerates all characters
to be converted; the right string enumerates the replacement characters. The default is /\* __x, which means that
slashes and backslashes are converted to underscores, while the asterisk becomes an x.</li>
<li><em>Replace underscore by dot</em>: Another export conversion rule. All underscores are replaced by dots. This
rule is applied before the conversion.</li>
<li><em>Add file name suffix</em>: Add this suffix to export file names. May be left blank.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>The settings are saved to a file called <strong>tiimagetool.prop</strong> on
Windows systems (located in the home folder of the user). On other systems like
Linux the file is called <strong>.tiimagetoolrc</strong> and is located in the
user's home directory. Opening the file in an editor reveals some more settings
which the program saves for itself during usage. You can change the contents
of this file as long as you keep its structure (name=value pairs).
</p>

<a name="exit"></a>
<h3>Exit</h3>
<p>Terminates the program. Changes to image file are always committed immediately,
so there is no need to explicitly exit the program by this option. However,
preferences are saved on exit. Closing the main window is equivalent to this
menu function.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p><strong>CHD format</strong> is a container format used by the MAME emulator.
It is used to store contents of mass storage devices like hard disks, CD-ROMs,
Laserdisks, and more. The CHD format (short for "Compressed Hunks of Data") 
allows for compressing the contents and for checking the integrity using checksums
and digests. For hard disk images the CHD container must stay uncompressed because
the contents are likely to change during usage (unlike CD-ROMs which remain
unchanged).</p>
<a name="DSR"></a><p><strong>DSR</strong> is short for <em>Device service routine</em>
and would be called a device driver (or firmware) in the PC world.</p>
<p><strong>LONG format</strong> is used by Extended Basic when a program does
not fit into the free space of video memory. Although it may reside in the 
memory expansion, the BASIC code must be copied into the video memory to be 
saved in PROGRAM format. If this is not possible the program is stored
in a record structure file instead of in a program file.</p>
<p><strong>RXTX</strong> is a free implementation of the java.comm API. 
TIImageTool links to these classes, so you must use RXTX and no alternative 
implementation. Please visit the RXTX homepage and download the binary package.
Installation of RXTX is very simple; you only have to put the <em>RXTXcomm.jar</em> and 
the <em>librxtxSerial.so</em> (Unix) or <em>rxtxSerial.dll</em> (Windows) into
your Java installation. For Windows, search the folders <em>ext</em> (for the jar file)
and <em>bin</em> (for the dll) in your Java installation (in Program Files) and copy the files into them.
Restart TIImageTool, and the XModem options should be available.</p>
<p><strong>SDF images</strong> are in <em>sector dump format</em>, which means that the image 
consists of consecutive sector contents. This format is also known as <strong>v9t9</strong> format,
named after the v9t9 emulator which used this format first. SDF image files should use the 
suffix <strong>.dsk</strong>. SDF images are always assumed to have a size 
of a multiple of 256. There is a known extension of the SDF format with a map
of bad sectors (768 bytes) at the end; this is detected and ignored, allowing to
work with this image.</p>
<p><strong>TDF images</strong> are in <em>track dump format</em>, which means that the image
consists of whole track dumps including data outside of sectors. This format uses more space
that the SDF format, but is more accurate to the structure of the real medium. This format is also 
known as <strong>PC99</strong> format, named after the PC99 emulator. TDF image files should use the 
suffix <strong>.dtk</strong>. In everyday usage, the SDF format should be preferred as it is 
more common among the different emulators, and it is also much less overhead
during processing, which could be important if you run the emulator on a weaker PC.
Note that the TDF format differs from the PC99 formats for single-sided disks. 
If you intend to create disk images for the PC99 emulator, only use double-sided
formats.</p>
<p><strong>HFE images</strong> are images that represent the flux changes
on the disk medium. They are used in the Lotharek Floppy Disk Emulator.</p>
<p><strong>TIFILES</strong> is a format for the external storage of TI-99 file system
files on PCs. TIFILES files contain the file contents and meta-information about the file,
like the file type and the file structure. This information is required for
restoring the file in a TI-99 file system. TIFILES files are therefore well suited
to be stored on file servers, and the Classic99 emulator uses TIFILES directly.
TIFILES files should use the suffix <strong>.tifiles</strong>, 
<strong>.tifile</strong>, or <strong>.tfi</strong>.</p>
</a><p><strong>Valid names</strong><a name="valid"> for files and directories on TI disk images may
use any character from the set of ASCII characters except for the period ("."). 
Names may even use non-printable ASCII characters (below 32). They must be at
most 10 characters long.</p>
