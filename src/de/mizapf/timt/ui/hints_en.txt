# Hint file
# Number = Text
0 = There is a new feature called "Hints" which, on startup and by selection 
in the Help menu, give you helpful information on new program features and 
the way you can use them. You can turn off the hints completely or just 
deselect single ones at any time.
1 = We have a pretty long reference manual for TIImageTool in the Help menu
2 = You should have a look at the settings in the <em>File->Preferences</em> menu 
3 = You can create disk images from SSSD to DSHD (90 KiB to 1.4 MiB), 
preformatted or blank, by a few clicks (<em>File->New</em>).
4 = The most recently used 10 image files are available by a single click in the Open Recent
menu item.
5 = You can create ready-to-use hard disk images (CHD) for use in MAME under <em>File->New</em>.
6 = We have full copy/paste support for file transfer between images, 
directories, and even for export and import: Press Ctrl-C in a directory view 
and you will notice that you can paste the file into your host file system. 
Cutting is not supported for export and import, only for transfer between
disk images.
7 = You can drag and drop files and directories not only between 
directory views in TIImageTool, but also to your PC file system.
8 = There is a full XModem support so that you can send and receive files via 
a serial connection (<em>Edit->Import</em> from remote). You can, for instance, run TELCO
on your TI to exchange files with TIImageTool.
9 = Files created by Archiver can be opened just like a directory, and you can
even cut, copy, and paste files from or into it on the fly. Yes, you can
open archives inside archives. You can even rename a file inside a nested archive.
10 = You can import binary files as PROGRAM files.
11 = You can import text files as DIS/VAR 80 files, which is pretty useful 
for assembler source code.
12 = TIImageTool automatically finds out whether a PROGRAM file is a BASIC
program, and if so, produces a BASIC listing. It can also load BASIC programs 
in MERGE format as well as in LONG format.
13 = Several picture formats are recognized: TI-ARTIST, MyArt, YAPP, RLE-128,
and FRACTALS. Double-clicking on such a file opens the picture in a window. 
14 = You can create directories on hard disk and floppy images, but on floppy
images, you can only create three directories inside the root directory and none
in deeper levels.
15 = There is a file system checker in the menu <em>Utility->Check filesystem</em> which
checks for under-/over-/cross-allocation issues, for L3 record count errors,
and for CRC errors in track dump images.
16 = There is a context menu which is displayed when you click the right mouse button within
a directory view. If your mouse does not offer a right button, you can choose
to include the context menu in the main menu.
17 = Directory views can be detached from the main window so that you can easily
compare image contents and use drag-and-drop to copy or move contents. When you
close a detached view, it becomes a tab in the main window. When you close the
main window, all windows are closed.
18 = You can open an image more than once, which makes it quite simple to apply
cut/copy/paste or drag-and-drop within the image.
19 = files can be exported in TIFILES format into the host file system, and 
you can specify in <em>File->Preferences</em> how the external file name shall
be determined.
20 = Besides files, you can also export directories and their contained 
files and subdirectories. In order to preserve the directory name, the name
is stored in a file called <em>meta.inf</em>.
21 = When you import a file you can tell TIImageTool to ignore the file name 
in the TIFILES header and take the file name from the host file system, with 
automatic replacement of unsupported characters.
22 = There is a TMS9900 disassembler in TIImageTool which allows you to 
specify regions which shall not be disassembled (text or data), and these settings
are persistently stored for each file so you do not have to re-enter them again.
23 = The TMS9900 disassembler takes PROGRAM files or DIS/FIX 80 files, and 
it can produce syntactically correct source code that can be assembled again.
24 = there is a GPL disassembler in TIImageTool that can be configured to
exclude regions from disassembly and that stores its settings for each file
so that you do not have to enter them again.
25 = You can create a Geneve floppy or hard boot disk with the menu function 
<em>Utility->Install Geneve OS</em>. All necessary files, including GeneveOS, must
be stored in a directory that you can specify.
26 = TIImageTool works on the image exclusively in memory; changes are only 
applied by the “Save” function.
27 = TIImageTool provides the Serial Bridge feature, which allows MAME to
communicate with a real TI via a serial connection.
28 = There is a command line mode in TIImageTool which can be used to get a 
directory listing or to output a text file located in an
image file. Use <em>java -classpath tiimagetool.jar de.mizapf.timt.CommandShell -h</em> 
to get more information.
29 = You can import BASIC programs from a text file or the built-in text editor;
just copy and paste a BASIC listing from a website into your image file.
30 = Output from the program, including error messages, can now be logged in
a file; you can set the file name in the preferences.
31 = You can directly read, write, and create image files for the Lotharek/GoTek Floppy Disk Emulator.
32 = There is a Search feature in the Utility menu by which you can look
for file names and even for file contents.
33 = There is a sector editor in the <em>Utilities</em> which allows you to edit sectors
of floppy or HD images, even of HFE images.
34 = TIImageTool offers various UI languages that you can change in the preferences.
35 = You have to read and write CF7 cards with your own tool, but you can add 
or delete volumes on these images using TIImageTool and edit these volumes individually.
36 = You can not only open text and BASIC files, but also edit and save them.
37 = You can undo most operations, or change your mind and redo them.
38 = You have to choose the image format at the time of saving. That way, you can
easily save an existing image in another format.
39 = TIImageTool supports SCSI and IDE images, the latter with up to 8 partitions.
40 = You can freely define image file suffixes so that those are visible in the file dialogs. 
41 = Below the file listing, a small gap remains where you can right-click without
selecting a file.
42 = If you save a partition or volume using "Save As", it will be saved as a 
separate image. If you have just changed something and want to save it, use "Save".
43 = 43 = You can only view one partition of partitioned images (IDE/CF7)
at a time. You have to copy between partitions via an intermediate step.
