   dir <image_file> [<subdir>]
   ls  <image_file> [<subdir>]   (lists only file names)

Create binary dumps from GK files (GK files in TIFILES format):
   gkbin <tf_file>+ <basename>
  
Create TIFILES format file from the given file in image
   gettf <image> <pathname_in_image> <tf_file>

Put the tifiles file on the given image
   puttf <imagename> <tf_file> [<filename>]
  
Create a TIFILES file from the plain dump (as PROGRAM file):   
   maketf <plainfile> <tf_name> 

Creates a blank or formatted image file (format is SSSD ... DSUD), tracks may
be appended (like DSDD80):
   create <image> (blank|formatted) (sdf|tdf) <format>[<tracks>] [<name>] 

Extract content of tifiles file; for data files separate the records by 
EOR string: 
   type  <tf_file> [<EOR>|<outfile>]

the specified number of words:
   dis   <tf_file> [ address:wordcnt* ] 

List a BASIC program file:
   list <tf_file>
   
Convert a SCSI image for HFDC (suggestions in parentheses). If appplicable, 
fixes MaxAU bug. Caution: Image file is changed.  
   scsi2hfdc <image> <sect_per_track(32)> <step_speed(1)>  
             <reduced_write_curr(58)> <heads> <buf(0)> <precomp(29)>

Convert a HFDC image for SCSI. Caution: Image file is changed.
   hfdc2scsi <image>
