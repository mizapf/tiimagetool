==== 3.0.0 (March 2024)

== New features
- All image processing is now done in memory. Nothing is changed in the image 
file until explicitly saved
- "Save" and "Save as" were added. These operations commit all changes to the
image file and clear the undo/redo buffer.
- The disk image format (sector dump/track dump/HFE for floopy disks, raw/CHD
for hard disks) is now selected at the time of saving, not at the time of creation.
- Text display can now be edited. You can simply change text and BASIC files on 
the image without leaving TIImageTool.
- SCSI images are supported (512 byte/sec)
- IDE images (512 byte/sec) are supported, with up to 8 partitions, and the 
partition table can be edited.
- All file/directory operations on images may be undone, and also be redone before
saving.

== Fixes
- Copy/move and file selection / context menu
- YAPP G7 graphics format is supported
- Several font size issues were fixed
- Choosing an escape character in the TI character set now issues a warning.

== Enhancements
- Image file suffixes may be configured for file chooser dialogs
- Text output window keeps its size
- Editing of CF7 layout (adding/removing volumes)
- Directory views offer a blank space below the listing to allow the user to  
get the general context menu by clicking the right button outside of the directory
display
- Hard disk image layouts can be selected from predefined geometries or 
directly defined.
- For systems with one-button mice, the context menu can be included in the Edit menu
- Empty patterns (one to several bytes, like "00", "e5", or "deadbeef") can be 
defined for floppies and hard disks separately.
- For quick tests, you can simply create a floppy image in memory and discard it
without saving.

== Other changes
- MAME CHD format conversions were dropped, as all HD images are automatically
saved as v5. The option of downgrading was removed.
- Conversions between formats (floppy, hard disk) is now covered by "Save as" 
and choosing another format.
- Sector editor redesigned (simplified and faster)
- Return key can be used in several dialog windows as "OK"
- New background image
- CF7 reading and writing must be done outside of TIImageTool
