What's new?

==== 3.0.0 (March 2024)

1. All image processing is now done in memory. Nothing is changed in the image 
file until explicitly saved
2. "Save" and "Save as" were added. These operations commit all changes to the
image file.
3. The disk image format (sector dump/track dump/HFE for floopy disks, raw/CHD
for hard disks) must be chosen at the time of saving, not at the time of creation.
4. Conversions between formats is now handled by "Save as" and choosing another 
format.
5. For quick tests, you can simply create a floppy image in memory and discard it
without saving.
6. All file/directory operations on images may be undone, and also be redone before
saving.
7. MAME CHD format conversions were dropped, as all HD images are automatically
saved as v5.
8. Conversion between RAW and CHD formats were dropped, as thosae can now be 
chosen with "Save as".
9. SCSI images are supported (physical 512 bytes sectors)
10. IDE images are supported, also partitioned, and partitions can be edited.
11. Editing of CF7 layout (adding/removing volumes)
12. Hard disk image layouts can be selected from predefined geometries or 
directly defined.
13. Image file suffixes may be configured for file chooser dialogs
14. Several font size issues were fixed
15. Directory views offer a blank space below the listing to allow the user to  
get the general context menu
16. Choosing an escape character in the TI character set now issues a warning.
17. Fixed right-click behavior

19. YAPP G7 graphics format is supported

22. Empty patterns (one to several bytes) can be defined for floppies and hard disks
separately.

files on the image.
